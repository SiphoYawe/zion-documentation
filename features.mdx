## Why Zion is Different

### Built by Educators for Educators

Zion was created by people who understand **ACE methodology** and the unique challenges of Christian education.

**ACE-Specific Design:**
- PACE curriculum integration (not generic "courses")
- Goal Check methodology (not generic "assignments")
- Multi-centre management (common in ACE schools)
- Character development tracking (biblical worldview integration)
- 3-stage moderation workflow (ACE compliance)

### Intelligence, Not Just Automation

Most school systems just digitize existing processes. Zion provides **predictive insights**:

- Identify struggling students **before** they fall seriously behind
- Discover patterns you&apos;d never notice manually ("Math completion drops on Fridays")
- Trend analysis shows if students are improving or declining
- Early warning alerts for at-risk students
- Data-driven decision making with confidence

### Massive Time Savings

**10+ hours saved per week:**
- Goal Check compilation: 2-3 hours → <1 minute
- Daily reports: 30-60 minutes → <30 seconds
- Weekly reports: 2-4 hours → <1 minute
- Report cards (Phase 2): 8-20 hours → <5 minutes

**Total Phase 1 savings:** 10+ hours/week = 40+ hours/month = 400+ hours/year
