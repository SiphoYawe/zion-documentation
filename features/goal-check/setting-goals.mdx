## Goal Entry Interface

### Table Structure

**Layout:**
- **Rows:** One row per student in your centre(s)
- **Column Groups:** Each student has columns for their assigned PACEs
- **Cells:** Goal start page, goal end page, goal total pages

**Example Table:**
```
Student Name | Math 1015             | English 1025          | Science 1035
             | Start | End | Total   | Start | End | Total   | Start | End | Total
John Smith   | 15    | 20  | 6 pages | 10    | 16  | 7 pages | 5     | 10  | 6 pages
Mary Jones   | 22    | 28  | 7 pages | 18    | 23  | 6 pages | 12    | 17  | 6 pages
```

### Fields Explained

**Goal Start Page:**
- Page number where student will begin work today
- Example: 15 (student starts on page 15)
- Must be ≤ goal end page
- Must be ≤ total PACE pages (typically 36)

**Goal End Page:**
- Page number where student should finish work today
- Example: 20 (student should reach page 20)
- Must be ≥ goal start page
- Must be ≤ total PACE pages

**Goal Total Pages:**
- Auto-calculated: End - Start + 1
- Example: Pages 15-20 = 6 total pages
- Read-only field (cannot edit directly)
- This is the target page count for the day

## Entering Goals Manually

### Basic Entry Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Goal Start Page Field">
    For first student and first PACE
  </Step>

  <Step title="Type Start Page Number">
    Example: 15
  </Step>

  <Step title="Press Tab or Click Next Field">
    Moves to Goal End Page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Type End Page Number">
    Example: 20
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Total Pages">
    System calculates automatically (6 pages in this example)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move to Next PACE">
    Press Tab to continue to next PACE for same student
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat for All PACEs">
    Each student typically has 4-6 PACEs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move to Next Student">
    After completing all PACEs for one student, Tab moves to next student
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Tab:** Move to next field (right)
**Shift+Tab:** Move to previous field (left)
**Enter:** Move down to same field for next student
**Arrow Keys:** Navigate any direction

**Power User Tip:**
Use Enter key to move down column by column (faster than Tab for vertical data entry).

### Auto-Save Behavior

**Automatic Saving:**
- Data saves 500ms after you stop typing
- No "Submit All" button required
- Each field saves independently

**Save Indicators:**
- Green checkmark appears when field saved
- Spinner shows while saving
- Red X indicates save failed (check internet)

**No Save Required:**
- Just enter data and navigate away when done
- All entered data is already saved
- Safe to close browser after seeing checkmarks

## Using Quick Templates

### Copy Previous Day

**Purpose:**
Pre-fill all goals with yesterday&apos;s values to save time.

**How It Works:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Copy Previous Day Button">
    Located at top of goal entry page
  </Step>

  <Step title="System Loads Yesterday's Data">
    All goal start/end pages populate from yesterday
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust as Needed">
    Modify goals for students who completed or missed yesterday
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Automatically">
    Changes auto-save as you modify
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Time Savings:**
- Manual entry: 5+ minutes for 20 students
- Copy previous day + adjust: 2-3 minutes
- 50%+ time reduction

**When to Use:**
- Most days (this should be your default)
- Provides continuity day-to-day
- Students progress through PACEs sequentially

**When NOT to Use:**
- First day of term (no previous day exists)
- After long break (students may need reassessment)
- After major PACE changes

### Adjusting After Copy Previous Day

**Students Who Completed Yesterday&apos;s Goal:**
- Update start page to yesterday&apos;s end page + 1
- Set new end page based on standard goal pages
- Example: Yesterday was 15-20, today should be 21-26

**Students Who Missed Yesterday&apos;s Goal:**
- Option 1: Repeat same pages (if struggling)
- Option 2: Adjust to partial completion (if made some progress)
- Example: Yesterday was 15-20 but only completed to 17, today could be 17-22

**Students Who Exceeded Yesterday&apos;s Goal:**
- Update start page to yesterday&apos;s actual end page + 1
- May increase goal pages if student is excelling
- Example: Yesterday goal 15-20 but completed to 23, today could be 24-30

### Standard Goal Templates by Grade

**Primary Grades (1-4):**
- 5-6 pages per subject per day
- Shorter attention spans, slower reading
- Example: Math 1-6, English 1-6, Science 1-5

**Middle Grades (5-8):**
- 7-8 pages per subject per day
- Building speed and comprehension
- Example: Math 10-17, English 5-12, Science 8-15

**High School (9-12):**
- 9-10 pages per subject per day
- Faster readers, stronger work habits
- Example: Math 15-24, English 20-29, Science 10-19

**These Are Guidelines:**
- Adjust based on individual student ability
- Some PACEs harder than others (adjust accordingly)
- Student motivation and focus matter

## Validation and Error Handling

### Validation Rules

**Zion Validates Your Entries:**

1. **Goal Start Page ≤ Goal End Page**
   - Valid: Start 15, End 20
   - Invalid: Start 20, End 15 (end must be ≥ start)

2. **Goal End Page ≤ PACE Total Pages**
   - Valid: End 30 (if PACE has 36 pages)
   - Invalid: End 40 (if PACE only has 36 pages)

3. **Goal Start Page ≥ 1**
   - Valid: Start 1
   - Invalid: Start 0 or negative number

4. **Numeric Values Only**
   - Valid: 15
   - Invalid: "fifteen", "15a", blank

### Error Messages

**Common Errors:**

**"Goal start page must be less than or equal to goal end page"**
- Cause: Start page > end page
- Example: Start 25, End 20
- Fix: Swap values or adjust one of them

**"Goal end page exceeds PACE total pages"**
- Cause: End page > PACE length
- Example: End 40 (PACE only has 36 pages)
- Fix: Set end page to 36 or less

**"Please enter a valid number"**
- Cause: Non-numeric input
- Example: "twenty" instead of 20
- Fix: Enter digits only

**"Goal pages seem unusually high"**
- Cause: Total pages > 15 (warning, not error)
- Example: Start 1, End 20 (20 pages)
- Warning: Consider if student can realistically complete this
- Can proceed, but review goal difficulty

### Fixing Errors

**Error Display:**
- Red border around invalid field
- Error message in red text below field
- Cannot save until corrected

**How to Fix:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read Error Message">
    Understand what&apos;s wrong
  </Step>

  <Step title="Correct the Value">
    Type new valid value
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Auto-Fix">
    Red border should disappear
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for Checkmark">
    Green checkmark means saved successfully
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Goal Setting

### Philosophy: Achievable Over Ambitious

**Key Principle:**
Better to set lower goals that students can consistently meet than high goals they&apos;ll consistently miss.

**Why:**
- Meeting goals builds confidence and momentum
- Missing goals daily is demotivating
- Consistent achievement creates positive habits
- You can always increase goals for students who excel

**Target Success Rate:**
- 80-85% of students should meet goals daily
- If &lt;70% meeting goals, goals are too high
- If >95% meeting goals, goals may be too low

### Individualization

**Every Student is Different:**

**Advanced Students:**
- 10-12 pages per subject possible
- Can handle more challenging PACEs
- May complete multiple PACEs per term

**Average Students:**
- 6-8 pages per subject typical
- Standard PACE progression
- Meet most goals with effort

**Struggling Students:**
- 3-5 pages per subject may be appropriate
- Need more time to understand concepts
- Better to progress slowly than not at all

**Don&apos;t:**
- Set same goals for all students (not individualized)
- Compare students to each other (different abilities)
- Push struggling students too hard (causes frustration)

### PACE Difficulty Consideration

**Not All Pages Are Equal:**

**Easy PACE Sections:**
- Review pages (student already knows content)
- Reading-heavy pages (less problem-solving)
- Early PACE pages (introductory content)
- Can set higher page counts (8-10 pages)

**Difficult PACE Sections:**
- New concept introduction
- Math problem-heavy pages
- Science experiments or analysis
- Can set lower page counts (4-6 pages)

**How to Know:**
- Preview PACE content if possible
- Ask students about difficulty
- Review past variance (if always missing in certain sections, they&apos;re hard)

### Daily Patterns and Adjustments

**Monday:**
- Students may need warm-up after weekend
- Consider slightly lower goals
- Or repeat Friday&apos;s goals

**Mid-Week (Tue-Thu):**
- Students in routine, most productive days
- Standard or slightly higher goals appropriate

**Friday:**
- Students may be fatigued
- Completion often drops on Fridays
- Consider slightly lower goals or review content

**After Breaks (Holidays, Vacations):**
- Students need re-entry time
- Lower goals for first 2-3 days back
- Gradually return to normal goals

## Advanced Goal-Setting Techniques

### Batch Setting by Subject

**Technique:**
Set all Math goals across all students, then all English goals, etc.

**Advantage:**
- Easier to maintain consistency
- Faster than jumping between subjects
- Can apply subject-specific adjustments uniformly

**How:**
1. Set Math goals for Student 1-20
2. Set English goals for Student 1-20
3. Set Science goals for Student 1-20
4. Continue for all subjects

### Progressive Goal Adjustment

**Technique:**
Gradually increase or decrease goals over time based on student performance.

**Increasing Goals (Student Excelling):**
- Week 1: 6 pages per day
- Week 2: 7 pages per day (if consistently exceeding)
- Week 3: 8 pages per day (if still exceeding)
- Monitor variance to ensure not pushing too hard

**Decreasing Goals (Student Struggling):**
- Week 1: 8 pages per day
- Week 2: 7 pages per day (if consistently missing)
- Week 3: 6 pages per day (if still missing)
- Stabilize when student reaches 80% completion rate

### Term-Long Planning

**Week-by-Week Strategy:**

**Weeks 1-2 (Term Start):**
- Conservative goals to establish routine
- Focus on habit-building over volume
- Example: 5-6 pages per subject

**Weeks 3-10 (Mid-Term):**
- Standard goals based on student ability
- Peak productivity period
- Example: 7-8 pages per subject

**Weeks 11-12 (Term End):**
- May need to increase goals to complete PACEs on schedule
- Or reduce goals if term exhaustion setting in
- Balance completion vs. burnout

## Multi-Centre Goal Setting

**If You Supervise Multiple Centres:**

### Centre Filtering

**Filter Table by Centre:**
1. Use centre dropdown at top of page
2. Select one centre at a time
3. Set goals for all students in that centre
4. Switch to next centre
5. Repeat

**Advantage:**
- Less overwhelming than seeing all centres at once
- Easier to focus on one group of students
- Reduces scrolling and confusion

### Applying Consistent Standards

**Same Goals Across Centres:**
- If centres have similar students (grade/ability), use same goal templates
- Example: Both Faith and Grace centres: 7 pages Math, 6 pages English

**Different Goals by Centre:**
- If centres differ significantly, adjust accordingly
- Example: Primary centre (5 pages), High School centre (10 pages)

## Troubleshooting Goal Setting

### "I Can&apos;t See Any Students"

**Causes:**
1. You&apos;re not assigned to any centres
2. Your centres have no students
3. Students have no PACE assignments

**Solutions:**
1. Contact administrator about centre assignment
2. Add students to your centres
3. Assign PACEs to students

### "Copy Previous Day Not Working"

**Causes:**
1. No goals set yesterday (nothing to copy)
2. Different students today than yesterday
3. PACE assignments changed since yesterday

**Solutions:**
1. Enter goals manually for first day
2. Copy will only pre-fill students who had goals yesterday
3. Manually set goals for new PACEs

### "Goals Not Saving"

**Causes:**
1. Internet connection lost
2. Invalid data (errors in fields)
3. Session expired

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet (offline banner will appear)
2. Review fields for red error messages
3. Refresh page and log in again

### "Can&apos;t Edit Goals After Progress Marked"

**Cause:**
- Once progress marked for a day, goals become read-only for that student/date
- Prevents accidental changes to historical data

**Solution:**
- If you need to correct goals, contact administrator
- They can unlock for editing (with audit trail)

## Goal Setting FAQs

**Q: How long does goal setting take?**
A: 5 minutes for 20 students using "Copy Previous Day" + adjustments. 10 minutes if entering manually.

**Q: Can I set goals in advance (tomorrow, next week)?**
A: No, goals must be set same-day for accuracy. This ensures goals reflect current student status.

**Q: What if a student is absent?**
A: Set goals anyway (for record-keeping). At end of day, mark 0 pages completed.

**Q: Student finished PACE yesterday - what do I set today?**
A: Assign new PACE first (administrator task), then set goals for new PACE.

**Q: Can I set different goals for each PACE for same student?**
A: Yes! Example: 6 pages Math (difficult), 8 pages English (easier), 5 pages Science (new topic).

**Q: What&apos;s a reasonable goal page range?**
A: 3-12 pages per subject depending on grade and ability. Average is 6-8 pages.

**Q: Should I set goals to align with self-tests or checkups?**
A: Yes, good practice. Example: If self-test on page 24, set goal to reach 24 by Thursday.
