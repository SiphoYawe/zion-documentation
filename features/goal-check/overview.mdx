# Goal Check Intelligence Overview

Goal Check is the heart of Zion - transforming ACE&apos;s daily goal-setting methodology from hours of manual compilation into less than 1 minute of automated intelligence.

## What is Goal Check?

In ACE schools, students set daily page goals for each PACE they&apos;re working on. At end of day, supervisors check if students met their goals. This "Goal Check" process provides accountability and progress tracking.

**Traditional Goal Check (Manual):**
- Supervisors track goals on paper or whiteboards
- End of day: Manually compile completion data
- Create handwritten or typed summaries
- Time required: 2-3 hours per day
- Result: Limited insights, prone to errors, difficult to track trends

**Zion Goal Check (Automated):**
- Digital goal entry (5 minutes in morning)
- Real-time progress tracking throughout day
- Automated progress marking (5 minutes at end of day)
- One-click report generation (&lt;30 seconds)
- Time required: ~10 minutes per day
- Result: Rich insights, 100% accurate, trend analysis, predictive alerts

**Time Saved:** 2-3 hours → 10 minutes = **10+ hours saved per week**

## How Goal Check Works in Zion

### Morning: Goal Setting

**Who:** Supervisors or Monitors
**Where:** Goal Check → Set Goals
**Time:** 5 minutes for 20 students

1. Select today&apos;s date
2. For each student and PACE, enter:
   - Goal start page (e.g., 15)
   - Goal end page (e.g., 20)
   - Goal total pages (auto-calculated: 6 pages)
3. Goals auto-save as you type
4. Navigate away when done

**Features:**
- Copy previous day&apos;s goals as template
- Standard goal templates by grade level
- Validation prevents invalid page ranges
- Tablet-optimized for on-the-go entry

---

### Throughout the Day: Real-Time Monitoring

**Who:** Administrators and Supervisors
**Where:** Dashboard
**Time:** 30 seconds for quick check

**Administrator Dashboard Shows:**
- School-wide completion status
- Total students with goals set today
- Real-time completion % as goals are marked
- Which centres need attention
- At-risk students

**Supervisor Dashboard Shows:**
- My centres&apos; completion status
- Student-by-student progress table
- Real-time updates as I mark progress
- Alerts for my students
- My centres&apos; 7-day trends

---

### End of Day: Progress Marking

**Who:** Supervisors or Monitors
**Where:** Goal Check → Mark Progress
**Time:** 5 minutes for 20 students

1. Select today&apos;s date
2. For each student and PACE:
   - View goal pages (set this morning)
   - Enter actual start page completed
   - Enter actual end page completed
   - System calculates actual total pages
   - System shows variance (actual vs goal)
3. Add optional notes for struggling students
4. Progress auto-saves

**Completion Logic:**
- **Completed:** Actual pages ≥ goal pages (met or exceeded)
- **Missed:** Actual pages < goal pages (fell short)
- **Exceeded:** Actual pages > goal pages (did extra)

**Variance Examples:**
- Goal: 6 pages, Actual: 6 pages = 0 variance (met exactly)
- Goal: 6 pages, Actual: 8 pages = +2 variance (exceeded by 2)
- Goal: 6 pages, Actual: 4 pages = -2 variance (missed by 2)

### Report Generation

**Daily Centre Reports:**
- Generated when all students in a centre are marked
- Shows: centre summary, student-by-student breakdown, at-risk students
- Export: PDF and CSV formats
- Time: &lt;30 seconds to generate

**Weekly School Reports:**
- Generated for whole school across full week
- Shows: school summary, daily breakdown, centre comparison, subject analysis, at-risk students, trend indicators
- Export: PDF and CSV formats
- Time: &lt;1 minute to generate for 200-student school

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Dashboards

**Administrator Dashboard:**
- Today&apos;s school-wide snapshot
- Weekly trends visualization (last 7 days)
- Centre comparison (which centres performing well)
- At-risk alerts
- Quick actions to all features

**Supervisor Dashboard:**
- My centres&apos; snapshot
- Student progress table with real-time updates
- My centres&apos; trends (last 7 days)
- My alerts (students in my centres)
- Daily report readiness status

### 2. Automated Reporting

**Daily Centre Reports:**
- Centre-level performance summary
- Student-by-student detail
- At-risk student identification
- PDF and CSV export

**Weekly School Reports:**
- Whole-school summary
- Daily breakdown (Mon-Fri)
- Centre comparison (ranked)
- Subject analysis
- At-risk students
- Trend indicators (current vs previous week)

### 3. Variance Tracking

Unlike simple yes/no completion, Zion tracks **how much** students missed or exceeded goals:

- **Positive Variance (+2):** Student did 2 more pages than goal
- **Zero Variance (0):** Student met goal exactly
- **Negative Variance (-2):** Student did 2 fewer pages than goal

This granular data enables:
- Trend analysis (is student improving or declining?)
- Goal adjustment (are goals too high/low?)
- Intervention planning (which students need support?)

### 4. At-Risk Student Alerts

Zion automatically identifies students needing intervention:

**Alert Criteria:**
- 3+ consecutive days missing goals
- Declining trend (performance dropping >20% over 2 weeks)
- Subject-specific struggle (consistently missing in one subject)

**Alert Display:**
- Dashboard alerts section
- Color-coded severity (critical vs warning)
- Recommended actions
- Historical trend data

### 5. Data Export

Export all Goal Check data for:
- Custom analysis in Excel
- Integration with other systems
- Long-term archiving
- ACE accreditation reporting

**Export Options:**
- CSV format with all fields
- Flexible filters (date range, centre, student, status, subject)
- Complete audit trail included
- Large exports processed as background jobs

## Best Practices

### Goal Setting

1. **Start Achievable:** Better to set lower goals students can meet than high goals they&apos;ll consistently miss
2. **Use Previous Day:** Copy yesterday&apos;s goals as starting point, adjust based on completion
3. **Consider PACE Difficulty:** Some sections harder than others - adjust accordingly
4. **Student Ability Matters:** Advanced students can handle more pages, struggling students need fewer

### Progress Marking

1. **Mark Daily:** Don&apos;t let marking pile up - daily marking enables trend tracking
2. **Add Notes:** Always note why student struggled (helps plan interventions)
3. **Be Honest:** Enter actual pages completed, not what you wish they completed
4. **Review Variance:** Use variance data to adjust future goals

### Reporting

1. **Daily Check:** Glance at dashboard daily (30 seconds)
2. **Weekly Deep Dive:** Generate and analyze weekly report every Friday
3. **Share Insights:** Distribute reports to leadership and supervisors
4. **Plan Interventions:** Use at-risk data to proactively support students

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to set goals every day?**  
A: Yes, for the system to work. But it only takes 5 minutes with copy-previous-day feature.

**Q: What if a student completes different pages than their goal?**  
A: Enter the actual pages they completed. Variance will reflect the difference.

**Q: Can I change goals after setting them?**  
A: Yes, goals are editable until you mark progress.

**Q: What if I forget to mark progress one day?**  
A: You can go back and mark any past date. Historical data is preserved.

**Q: How do I know which students need intervention?**  
A: Check At-Risk Alerts on dashboard - students with 3+ consecutive misses are flagged.
