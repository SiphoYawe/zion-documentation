## Troubleshooting Export Issues

### "Export Button Disabled"

**Causes:**
1. No data matches selected filters
2. Date range invalid (start after end)
3. Not logged in as administrator

**Solutions:**
1. Adjust filters to broader selection
2. Verify date range
3. Log in with administrator account

### "Export Taking Too Long"

**Causes:**
- Exporting large dataset (50,000+ rows)
- Server under load

**Solutions:**
- Wait for background job to complete (check email)
- Reduce date range or filters
- Retry during off-peak hours (early morning)

### "CSV File Won&apos;t Open"

**Causes:**
1. File corrupted during download
2. No CSV-compatible app installed
3. Browser download failed

**Solutions:**
1. Re-download from Download History
2. Install Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice
3. Try different browser

### "Data Looks Incorrect"

**Causes:**
1. Misunderstanding data structure
2. Filters not configured as intended
3. Data entry errors in Zion

**Verify:**
1. Review column headers and data types
2. Check preview before export
3. Spot-check few rows against Zion interface data

A: No hard limit. Exports of 100,000+ rows possible via background job.

**Q: Can I schedule automatic exports?**
A: Not yet - planned feature. Currently manual export only.

**Q: Can I export as PDF instead of CSV?**
A: No, raw data export is CSV only. Use Reports feature for PDF exports.
