# Goal Check Reports

Comprehensive guide to generating, interpreting, and using Zion&apos;s automated Goal Check reports. Transform daily data into actionable intelligence in under 30 seconds.

## Reports Overview

**Two Report Types:**

1. **Daily Centre Reports** - Single centre, single day performance
2. **Weekly School Reports** - Whole school, full week performance

**What Traditional Goal Check Reports Took:**
- 2-3 hours of manual compilation per day
- Error-prone calculations
- Limited insights
- Difficult to identify patterns

**What Zion Reports Take:**
- Less than 30 seconds to generate
- 100% accurate automated calculations
- Rich insights with variance analysis
- Automatic at-risk student identification

## Daily Centre Reports

### Purpose and Use Cases

**Purpose:**
Document single centre&apos;s performance for a specific day with student-by-student detail.

**Use Cases:**
- End-of-day supervisor review
- Share performance with administrator
- Document centre achievement
- Identify students needing intervention
- Evidence for parent meetings
- Compliance documentation

**Who Can Generate:**
- Supervisors (for their assigned centres)

  </Step>
</Steps>

**Readiness Indicator:**
- **"Ready (25/25 students marked)"** - Generate now!

### Interpreting Daily Centre Reports

**Completion Rate Targets:**
- **85%+ = Excellent** - Goals well-calibrated, students succeeding
- **75-84% = Good** - Most students meeting goals
- **60-74% = Fair** - Goals may be too ambitious
- **<60% = Poor** - Significant issue, review goal difficulty

**Variance Patterns:**

**Centre-Wide Positive Variance:**
- Most students exceeded goals
- May indicate goals too low
- Consider increasing goals tomorrow

**Centre-Wide Negative Variance:**
- Most students missed goals
- May indicate goals too high or difficult day
- Consider lowering goals tomorrow

**Mixed Variance:**
- Some students over, some under
- Normal and expected pattern
- Goals appropriately challenging

**Subject-Specific Struggles:**
- All students struggling in one subject (e.g., Math)
- Indicates PACE difficulty or topic complexity
- Plan group review or lower goals for that subject

### Using Daily Reports

**End-of-Day Review (5 minutes):**
1. Generate report
2. Review completion rate
3. Identify at-risk students
4. Plan tomorrow&apos;s interventions

## Troubleshooting Reports

### "Cannot Generate Report - Data Incomplete"

**Cause:**
- Not all students in centre have progress marked
- Or week has missing days (holidays, weekends)

**Solution:**
1. Check readiness indicator
2. Mark progress for remaining students
3. If day was holiday/no school, that&apos;s normal - generate for available days

### "Report Generation Failed"

**Causes:**
1. Server error (rare)
2. Too much data (300+ students)
3. Internet connection lost

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 30 seconds and try again
2. Contact support if repeated failures
3. Check internet connection

### "Report Shows Incorrect Data"

**Common Causes:**
1. Viewing wrong date/week
2. Data entry errors (typos in progress marking)
3. Centre assignment changed mid-week

**Verify:**
1. Confirm date range at top of report
2. Spot-check few students&apos; data against actual PACEs
3. Review audit log if available

### "Report Download Not Working"

**Causes:**
1. Browser pop-up blocker
2. Browser download settings
3. No PDF viewer installed

**Solutions:**
1. Allow pop-ups for Zion domain
2. Check browser downloads folder
3. Install PDF viewer (Adobe Reader, Preview, etc.)
