# Marking Daily Progress

Comprehensive guide to marking actual pages completed at end of day. Learn how to enter progress efficiently, understand variance calculations, add meaningful notes, and use auto-save features.

## Progress Marking Overview

**Purpose:**
Record actual pages completed by each student to:
- Calculate whether students met their goals (variance)
- Track completion rates and trends
- Identify struggling students early
- Generate accurate reports
- Provide accountability

**Who Marks Progress:**
- Supervisors (for their assigned centres)
- Monitors (for their assigned centres)
- Administrators (for any centre)

**When to Mark Progress:**
- End of each school day
- After students complete their PACE work
- Takes 5 minutes for 20 students

---

## Progress Marking Interface

### Table Structure

**Layout:**
- **Rows:** One row per student in your centre(s)
- **Column Groups:** Each student has columns for their assigned PACEs
- **Goal Section (Read-Only):** Shows goals set this morning
- **Actual Section (Editable):** Where you enter actual pages completed

**Example Table:**
```
Student    | Math 1015                                    | English 1025
           | Goal Pages | Actual Start | Actual End | Actual Pages | Variance
John Smith | 6 (15-20)  | 15           | 19         | 5 pages      | -1
Mary Jones | 7 (22-28)  | 22           | 30         | 9 pages      | +2
```

### Fields Explained

**Goal Pages (Read-Only):**
- Shows goal set this morning
- Format: Total pages (start-end)
- Example: "6 pages (15-20)"
- Cannot edit (goals locked once progress marking begins)

**Actual Start Page:**
- Page number where student actually started work today
- Example: 15 (student started on page 15 as planned)
- Usually matches goal start page (but not always)
- Editable field - type the actual page

**Actual End Page:**
- Page number where student actually finished work today
- Example: 19 (student finished on page 19)
- May differ from goal end page (that&apos;s normal)
- Editable field - type the actual page

**Actual Total Pages:**
- Auto-calculated: Actual End - Actual Start + 1
- Example: Pages 15-19 = 5 total pages
- Read-only field (cannot edit directly)
- This is compared to goal pages for variance

**Variance:**
- Auto-calculated: Actual Total - Goal Total
- Example: 5 actual - 6 goal = -1 variance (missed by 1 page)
- Read-only field
- Color-coded: Green (0 or +), Red (-)

**Status Badge:**
- Auto-calculated based on variance
- Updates in real-time as you enter progress
- Possible values:
  - **Green "Completed"**: Actual ≥ goal
  - **Blue "Exceeded"**: Actual > goal
  - **Red "Missed"**: Actual < goal
  - **Gray "Not Started"**: Progress not yet marked

## Entering Progress

### Basic Entry Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Physical PACE">
    Look at student&apos;s PACE to see which pages they completed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Actual Start Page Field">
    For first student and first PACE
  </Step>

  <Step title="Type Actual Start Page">
    Example: 15 (page where student started)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Press Tab or Click Next Field">
    Moves to Actual End Page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Type Actual End Page">
    Example: 19 (page where student finished)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Actual Total and Variance">
    System calculates automatically (5 pages actual, -1 variance in this example)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Status Badge">
    Badge updates to "Missed" (red) since variance is negative
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move to Next PACE">
    Press Tab to continue to next PACE for same student
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat for All PACEs">
    Each student typically has 4-6 PACEs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Notes if Needed">
    Click notes field if student struggled or excelled
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move to Next Student">
    After completing all PACEs for one student, Tab moves to next student
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Tab:** Move to next field (right)
**Shift+Tab:** Move to previous field (left)
**Enter:** Move down to same field for next student
**Arrow Keys:** Navigate any direction

**Efficient Entry Pattern:**
Use Enter key to mark same PACE across all students (vertical entry), then Tab to next PACE.

### Auto-Save Behavior

**Automatic Saving:**
- Data saves 500ms after you stop typing
- No "Submit All" button required
- Each field saves independently

**Save Indicators:**
- Green checkmark appears when field saved
- Spinner shows while saving
- Red X indicates save failed (check internet)

**Real-Time Updates:**
- Variance updates as you type
- Status badge changes immediately
- Dashboard updates in real-time (if refreshed)

## Understanding Variance

### Variance Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Variance = Actual Total Pages - Goal Total Pages
```

**Examples:**

**Positive Variance (Exceeded Goal):**
- Goal: 6 pages (15-20)
- Actual: 8 pages (15-22)
- Variance: +2 pages
- Meaning: Student did 2 more pages than goal
- Status: "Exceeded" (blue badge)

**Zero Variance (Met Goal Exactly):**
- Goal: 6 pages (15-20)
- Actual: 6 pages (15-20)
- Variance: 0 pages
- Meaning: Student met goal exactly
- Status: "Completed" (green badge)

**Negative Variance (Missed Goal):**
- Goal: 6 pages (15-20)
- Actual: 4 pages (15-18)
- Variance: -2 pages
- Meaning: Student did 2 fewer pages than goal
- Status: "Missed" (red badge)

### Interpreting Variance

**Positive Variance (+pages):**

**Occasional (+1 to +3):**
- Normal variation
- Student had good day
- PACE section easier than expected
- **Action:** Celebrate success, no changes needed

**Consistent (+3 to +5 for 3+ days):**
- Goals may be too low
- Student is excelling
- **Action:** Consider increasing goals slightly

**Extreme (+10+):**
- Goals significantly too low
- Data entry error (verify)
- Student skipped pages (check quality)
- **Action:** Review and adjust goals upward, or verify data accuracy

**Negative Variance (-pages):**

**Occasional (-1 to -2):**
- Normal variation
- Student had off day
- PACE section harder than expected
- **Action:** Note reason, monitor pattern

**Consistent (-3 to -5 for 3+ days):**
- Goals too high
- Student struggling
- **Action:** Lower goals or provide intervention

**Extreme (-10+):**
- Significant struggle
- Student absent or disrupted
- Goals unrealistic
- **Action:** Investigate cause, adjust goals significantly, provide support

### Zero Variance Myth

**It&apos;s Okay to NOT Have Zero Variance:**
- Zero variance is ideal, but not required
- Students are humans, not robots
- Variance is expected and normal
- Target: Most students within -2 to +2 range

**Red Flag:**
- ALL students exactly zero variance daily (may indicate inaccurate marking or unrealistic expectation)

## Adding Notes

### When to Add Notes

**Always Add Notes For:**
- Students who missed goals (explain why)
- Students who exceeded significantly (note what went well)
- Students absent or partially absent
- Unusual circumstances (illness, behavior issues, disruptions)

**Consider Notes For:**
- Students struggling with specific concept
- Students who completed work early
- PACEs that seem particularly difficult or easy
- Any context that helps explain variance

### How to Add Notes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Progress Entry">
    Enter actual start/end pages for student first
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Notes Field">
    Below student&apos;s PACE entries or in notes column
  </Step>

  <Step title="Type Brief Note">
    1-2 sentences maximum
  </Step>

  <Step title="Auto-Save">
    Notes save automatically as you type
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Note Writing Best Practices

**Good Notes (Specific and Actionable):**
- "Struggled with long division on pages 18-19, needs review"
- "Completed early, very focused today - consider increasing goals"
- "Absent afternoon for doctor appointment, partial completion"
- "Pages 15-17 very difficult, multiplication concepts need reinforcement"

**Poor Notes (Vague and Unhelpful):**
- "Did ok"
- "Struggled"
- "Good job"
- "Not great"

**Note Guidelines:**
- Be specific about what/why
- Include page numbers if relevant
- Note concepts or skills (not just "struggled")
- Keep brief (1-2 sentences)
- Focus on actionable information

### Notes for Common Scenarios

**Student Missed Goal:**
```
"Struggled with fraction division on pages 20-22, needs one-on-one help tomorrow"
```

**Student Exceeded Goal:**
```
"Completed pages 15-25 (goal was 15-20), excellent focus and understanding of topic"
```

**Student Absent:**
```
"Absent entire day for family emergency, no work completed"
```

**PACE Too Difficult:**
```
"All students struggled with pages 18-20 (geometry proofs), may need group review"
```

**External Disruption:**
```
"Fire drill during work time, lost 30 minutes of focus"
```

---

## Handling Special Cases

### Student Absent

**Full Day Absence:**
1. Leave actual start/end pages blank, OR
2. Enter 0 for both start and end
3. Add note: "Absent - [reason if known]"
4. Variance will show as negative (expected)
5. Status: "Missed"

**Partial Day Absence:**
1. Enter actual pages completed during time present
2. Add note: "Left at 11am for appointment, partial completion"
3. Variance reflects partial work (expected)

### Student Worked on Different Pages

**Scenario:** Goal was 15-20, but student worked on 25-30 instead.

**How to Handle:**
1. Enter actual pages student worked on (25-30)
2. Add note: "Worked on pages 25-30 instead of goal 15-20 - [reason]"
3. Variance will be off, but data is accurate
4. Follow up: Why did student work on different pages? Communicate with supervisor

### Student Skipped Pages

**Scenario:** Goal was 15-25, student marked 15-25 but skipped 18-20.

**How to Handle:**
1. Enter 15-25 (what student marked as "done")
2. Add note: "Skipped pages 18-20, needs to complete before advancing"
3. Variance shows as met/exceeded, but note flags quality issue
4. Follow up: Ensure student completes skipped pages

### Multiple PACEs in Same Subject

**Scenario:** Student finished Math 1015 and started Math 1016 in same day.

**How to Handle:**
1. Mark progress on Math 1015 (completed pages)
2. If Math 1016 not yet assigned, contact administrator to assign
3. Once assigned, set goals and mark progress for Math 1016
4. Add note: "Completed PACE 1015, started 1016"

### Student Repeated Same Pages

**Scenario:** Goal was 15-20, student redid 10-15 instead (review).

**How to Handle:**
1. Enter actual pages worked on (10-15)
2. Add note: "Redid pages 10-15 for review/mastery instead of advancing"
3. Variance will be negative (expected)
4. Follow up: Discuss with supervisor if review was necessary or student is struggling

## Progress Marking Best Practices

### Pre-Marking Preparation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collect All PACEs">
    Gather all students&apos; PACEs before starting Zion entry
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Work Quality">
    Quick scan to ensure students actually completed pages (not just marked)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Note Struggles">
    Mental note of students who struggled or excelled (for notes)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Organize by Student">
    Stack PACEs in student order to match Zion table
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Entry Strategies

**Strategy 1: Student-by-Student**
- Mark all PACEs for Student 1
- Move to Student 2, mark all PACEs
- Continue through all students
- **Advantage:** Complete picture of each student before moving on
- **Best for:** Smaller classes (10-15 students)

**Strategy 2: PACE-by-PACE**
- Mark Math for all students
- Mark English for all students
- Continue through all subjects
- **Advantage:** Easier to spot patterns across students in same subject
- **Best for:** Larger classes (20+ students)

**Strategy 3: Hybrid**
- Mark all struggling students first (need immediate notes)
- Then mark remaining students in batches
- **Advantage:** Prioritizes students needing attention
- **Best for:** Mixed-ability classes with known at-risk students

### Accuracy Tips

**Be Honest:**
- Enter actual pages completed, not what you wish they completed
- Accurate data enables better decision-making
- Inflating numbers helps no one

**Verify PACE Page Numbers:**
- Don&apos;t assume student marked pages correctly
- Check PACE physically to confirm pages completed
- Students may mark pages as "done" when incomplete

**Double-Check Math:**
- Ensure actual start ≤ actual end
- Verify calculated totals make sense
- System will validate, but catch obvious errors early

**Review Before Leaving:**
- Glance through table for any missing entries
- Check that all students marked (or noted as absent)
- Verify all checkmarks appeared (data saved)

---

## Completion Status and Badges

### Status Badge Colors

**Green "Completed"**
- Actual pages ≥ goal pages
- Variance: 0 or positive
- Example: Goal 6, Actual 6 or 7
- Meaning: Student met or slightly exceeded goal

**Blue "Exceeded"**
- Actual pages significantly > goal pages
- Variance: +3 or more
- Example: Goal 6, Actual 10
- Meaning: Student well exceeded goal

**Red "Missed"**
- Actual pages < goal pages
- Variance: Negative
- Example: Goal 6, Actual 4
- Meaning: Student did not meet goal

**Gray "Not Started"**
- Progress not yet marked
- No actual pages entered
- Meaning: Data entry pending

### Using Status for Quick Filtering

**Filter Table by Status:**
1. Click status dropdown at top of table
2. Select "Missed" to see only students who missed goals
3. Quickly add notes for all students who struggled

**View Completion Summary:**
- Top of page shows: "18 Completed, 2 Exceeded, 3 Missed, 2 Not Started"
- Quick glance at overall performance

## Troubleshooting Progress Marking

### "Cannot Mark Progress - No Goals Set"

**Cause:**
- Goals not yet set for selected date
- Must set goals before marking progress

**Solution:**
1. Navigate to Set Goals
2. Set goals for the date
3. Return to Mark Progress

### "Progress Not Saving"

**Causes:**
1. Internet connection lost
2. Invalid data (errors in fields)
3. Session expired

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet (offline banner will appear)
2. Review fields for red error messages
3. Refresh page and log in again

### "Variance Seems Wrong"

**Common Cause:**
- Mistyped actual start or end page

**Verify:**
1. Check actual start page matches student&apos;s PACE
2. Check actual end page matches student&apos;s PACE
3. Recalculate manually: End - Start + 1
4. Compare to goal pages

**Example of Error:**
- Goal: 15-20 (6 pages)
- Accidentally entered actual: 15-120 (typo, should be 15-20)
- Variance shows +114 (obviously wrong)
- **Fix:** Correct actual end to 20

### "Student Showing as Not Started But I Marked Them"

**Causes:**
1. Data didn&apos;t save (no checkmark)
2. Viewing wrong date
3. Viewing different student

**Solutions:**
1. Re-enter data and verify checkmark
2. Confirm date at top of page
3. Search for student name to verify

## Progress Marking FAQs

**Q: How long does progress marking take?**
A: 5 minutes for 20 students if organized. 10 minutes if unorganized or many notes needed.

**Q: Can I mark progress before end of day?**
A: Yes, but students may complete more work afterward. Best to wait until work time ends.

**Q: What if I mark progress incorrectly?**
A: Progress is editable same-day. Go back and correct the entry. After day ends, contact administrator to unlock.

**Q: Student worked on pages but didn&apos;t finish any - how do I mark?**
A: If student didn&apos;t complete any full pages, mark 0 pages with note explaining. Or mark partial pages if policy allows.

**Q: Can I see yesterday&apos;s progress while marking today?**
A: Yes, open two browser tabs - one for today (Mark Progress), one for yesterday (view only). Or check student&apos;s history.

**Q: Should variance always be calculated by system or can I override?**
A: System calculates automatically based on actual vs goal pages. No override needed or allowed.

**Q: Multiple students missed same goal - should I add same note for each?**
A: Yes, or add one note at top of page: "All students struggled with [concept] today."
