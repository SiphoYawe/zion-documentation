# Student Management Overview

Comprehensive overview of student management in Zion - from initial roster setup to ongoing maintenance, centre assignments, and PACE allocations. This guide helps administrators build and maintain an accurate student database.

## Why Student Management Matters

**Student Data is the Foundation:**
- Goal Check requires students with PACE assignments
- Accurate rosters enable proper centre assignments
- Clean data prevents errors in reporting
- Historical records support continuity year-to-year

**Zion&apos;s Student Management Enables:**
- Individual student profiles with all relevant information
- Learning centre assignments for proper Goal Check access
- PACE assignments for individualized pacing
- Status management (active vs deactivated)
- Historical tracking and reporting

## Student Management Workflow

### Initial Setup (Start of Year)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather Student Data">
    Collect names, DOB, grades, parent contact info from enrollment forms
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare CSV or Add Individually">
    For 20+ students, use CSV bulk import. For fewer, add individually.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import/Add Students">
    Create all student profiles in Zion
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to Learning Centres">
    Place students in appropriate centres based on grade/capacity
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign PACEs">
    Give each student 4-6 PACEs to start term
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Completeness">
    Check that all students have centres and PACEs assigned
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours for 100-student school using CSV bulk import

### Ongoing Maintenance (Throughout Year)

**Weekly Tasks (5 minutes):**
- Add new enrollments
- Process withdrawals (deactivate students)
- Update contact information as needed

**Monthly Tasks (15 minutes):**
- Audit for data quality (duplicates, missing info)
- Verify centre assignments still appropriate
- Check PACE progression (students advancing appropriately?)

**Term-End Tasks (1 hour):**
- Promote students to next grade level
- Reassign PACEs for new term
- Rebalance centre assignments
- Generate term-end reports
- Archive graduating students

## Adding Students

### Method 1: Individual Entry

**When to Use:**
- Adding 1-10 students
- Mid-year enrollments
- Quick additions
- Students with unique circumstances

**Process:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Students">
    Click "Management" → "Students" in sidebar
  </Step>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign PACEs">
    Immediately or later - assign 4-6 PACEs to enable Goal Check
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Time Required:** 2-3 minutes per student

### Method 2: CSV Bulk Import

**When to Use:**
- Adding 20+ students at once
- Start of academic year
- Transferring from another system
- Faster and less error-prone for large groups

**Process Overview:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download CSV Template">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill Template in Excel">
    One row per student with all required columns
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload CSV">
    Return to Zion, upload filled CSV
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate Data">
    Zion checks for errors, shows validation results
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Import">
    Review preview, click "Import X Students"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign PACEs">
    After import completes, assign PACEs to all students
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Time Required:** 10-15 minutes for 50 students (not including CSV preparation time)

**See [CSV Bulk Import Guide](/features/students/bulk-import) for detailed instructions.**

## Learning Centre Assignments

### Why Centre Assignments Matter

**Centre Assignment Enables:**
- **Supervisor Access:** Supervisors only see students in their assigned centres
- **Goal Check Workflow:** Students appear in correct supervisor&apos;s Goal Check entry
- **Reporting:** Centre-level reports show accurate student lists
- **Dashboard Filtering:** Real-time dashboards filter by centre

**Without Centre Assignment:**
- Student won&apos;t appear in any supervisor&apos;s Goal Check
- Cannot set goals or mark progress
- Missing from centre reports

### Initial Centre Assignment

**Factors to Consider:**

**Grade Level:**
- Group similar grades together (e.g., Grades 1-3 in one centre, 4-6 in another)
- Enables age-appropriate curriculum and pacing

**Centre Capacity:**
- Don&apos;t exceed capacity limits (typically 20-30 students per centre)
- Balanced class sizes enable better supervision

**Supervisor Workload:**
- Balance student count across supervisors
- Consider supervisor experience and strengths

**Student Needs:**
- Place students with special needs with appropriate supervisor
- Group students with similar ability levels if using ability-based centres

**Example Distribution (75-student school):**
- Primary Centre (Grades 1-3): 25 students
- Elementary Centre (Grades 4-6): 27 students
- Junior High Centre (Grades 7-9): 23 students

### Reassigning Students Between Centres

**Common Scenarios:**
- Grade progression (student moves from Primary to Elementary centre)
- Centre rebalancing (one centre too full, another has space)
- Student needs change (requires different supervisor approach)
- Supervisor changes (supervisor leaves, students reassigned)

**How to Reassign:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Student Profile">
    Find student in Students list, click name
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Edit">
    Edit button on student profile page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Learning Centre">
    Select new centre from dropdown
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Student immediately moves to new centre
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notify Supervisors">
    Inform both old and new supervisors of change
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Effect of Reassignment:**
- Student appears in new centre&apos;s Goal Check immediately
- Student removed from old centre&apos;s Goal Check
- Historical data preserved (shows which centre student was in at that time)

<Warning>
**Mid-Term Reassignments:** Avoid mid-term reassignments unless necessary. Disrupts student routine and supervisor relationships. Best to reassign during term breaks.
</Warning>

## PACE Assignments

### Why PACE Assignments Matter

**PACE Assignments Enable Goal Check:**
- Cannot set daily goals without assigned PACEs
- Goal entry interface shows assigned PACEs as columns
- Without PACEs, student effectively cannot use Goal Check

**Individualized Learning:**
- Each student has own PACE assignments
- Different students can work on different PACEs in same subject
- Enables true individualized pacing (core of ACE methodology)

**Progress Tracking:**
- Track which PACEs student has completed
- See when student started/finished each PACE
- Historical record of academic progression

### Assigning PACEs to Students

**Typical PACE Load:**
- **Light Load:** 3-4 PACEs (primary grades, struggling students)
- **Standard Load:** 5-6 PACEs (most students)
- **Heavy Load:** 7-8 PACEs (advanced students, high school)

**Subject Distribution:**
- Usually 1 PACE per subject concurrently
- Example: Math 1015 + English 1025 + Science 1035 + Social Studies 1045 + Word Building 1055 = 5 PACEs

**Process:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Student Profile">
    Click student name from Students list
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Assign PACE">
    In "Current PACEs" section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search PACE Catalog">
    Search by number, subject, or grade level
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select PACE">
    Click PACE to assign it
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat for All Subjects">
    Typically 4-6 PACEs total
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Assignments">
    Click "Save" when all PACEs selected
  </Step>
</Steps>

**See [PACE Assignments Guide](/features/students/pace-assignments) for detailed instructions.**

### PACE Progression

**When Student Completes a PACE:**
1. Administrator marks PACE as completed (future feature: auto-complete)
2. Assign next PACE in sequence (e.g., 1015 → 1016)
3. Student continues uninterrupted

**PACE Numbering:**
- 1001-1012: Grade 1 PACEs across subjects
- 1013-1024: Grade 2 PACEs
- 1025-1036: Grade 3 PACEs
- And so on through Grade 12 (1133-1144)

**See [PACE Catalog](/features/paces/catalog) for complete PACE reference.**

## Student Status Management

### Active vs Deactivated

**Active Students:**
- Appear in all lists, dashboards, Goal Check
- Can have goals set and progress marked
- Counted in reports and metrics
- This is default status for all students

**Deactivated Students:**
- Hidden from active lists (filter required to see)
- Cannot have new goals set
- NOT counted in active reports/metrics
- Historical data preserved (past Goal Check entries remain)
- Can be reactivated later if needed

### When to Deactivate Students

**Permanent Departures:**
- Student withdrew from school
- Student transferred to another school
- Graduated (optional - some schools keep graduates for historical records)

**Temporary Absences (Long-Term):**
- Extended illness (months)
- Family leave (semester abroad, etc.)
- Maternity leave (some older students)

**Administrative:**
- Duplicate student entries (deactivate duplicate, keep one)
- Data entry errors (create new correct entry, deactivate incorrect one)

**When NOT to Deactivate:**
- Short-term absences (days or weeks) - keep active, just mark 0 pages on absent days
- Summer break - keep active for continuity into next term
- Temporary suspensions - keep active

### How to Deactivate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Students List">
    Management → Students
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Student">
    Search or scroll to locate student
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Deactivate Button">
    Button next to student name
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Action">
    Read warning dialog, click "Deactivate"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Notes">
    Document why deactivated (date withdrew, reason)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What Happens:**
- Student immediately removed from active lists
- Supervisors no longer see student in Goal Check
- Historical Goal Check data remains intact
- Student profile still accessible with filter

### How to Reactivate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Students List">
    Management → Students
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle Show Deactivated">
    Filter at top of page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Student">
    Deactivated students show gray "Inactive" badge
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Reactivate Button">
    Button next to student name
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Information">
    Edit student to update grade, centre if needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify PACE Assignments">
    Ensure PACEs still appropriate (may need new assignments)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Student Data Quality

### Common Data Issues

**Duplicate Students:**
- Same student entered twice (different spellings, typos)
- Causes: Bulk import errors, multiple administrators adding students
- Detection: Sort students by name, look for similar names with same DOB
- Solution: Keep one entry, deactivate duplicate

**Missing Information:**
- Students without centre assignments
- Students without PACE assignments
- Missing contact information
- Solution: Regular audits to find and fix

**Incorrect Assignments:**
- Student in wrong grade level
- Student in wrong centre
- Student with inappropriate PACEs (too easy/hard)
- Solution: Spot-check randomly, correct as found

**Outdated Information:**
- Old contact information
- Students who withdrew but still active
- Graduated students still in system
- Solution: Annual cleanup (end of term)

### Monthly Data Audit Checklist

**Run These Checks Monthly (15 minutes):**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Students Without PACEs">
    Filter students, look for 0 PACE assignments
  </Step>

  <Step title="Students Without Centres">
    Check for unassigned students (shouldn&apos;t exist, but verify)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Duplicate Names">
    Sort by name, look for duplicates
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grade Appropriateness">
    Check for students with ages that don&apos;t match grade level
  </Step>

  <Step title="Inactive Status Review">
    Review deactivated students, confirm still should be deactivated
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Student Not Appearing in Goal Check"

**Causes:**
1. Student not assigned to learning centre
2. Student has no PACE assignments
3. Student is deactivated
4. Supervisor not assigned to student&apos;s centre

**Solutions:**
1. Assign student to a centre
2. Assign 4-6 PACEs to student
3. Reactivate student if appropriate
4. Verify supervisor assigned to correct centre

### "Cannot Deactivate Student"

**Cause:**
Student may have active Goal Check entries for today

**Solution:**
Wait until next day, or have supervisor remove today&apos;s entries, then deactivate

### "Duplicate Student Entries"

**Cause:**
Student added twice (CSV import + manual entry, or two administrators)

**Solution:**
1. Identify which entry has more/better data
2. Keep that one as active
3. Deactivate the duplicate
4. Note in deactivated entry: "Duplicate of [correct entry ID]"

### "Student in Wrong Grade for Age"

**Causes:**
1. Data entry error (typo in DOB or grade)
2. Student legitimately held back or advanced
3. Student transferred mid-year from different system

**Verify:**
Check enrollment forms for correct DOB and grade, correct as needed
