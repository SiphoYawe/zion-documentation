# PACE Assignments Guide

Complete guide to assigning PACEs (Packets of Accelerated Christian Education) to students in Zion. Learn subject distribution, appropriate PACE selection, progression management, and completion tracking.

## PACE Assignments Overview

**Why PACE Assignments Matter:**
- **Enable Goal Check:** Students must have assigned PACEs before daily goals can be set
- **Individualized Pacing:** Each student progresses at their own speed through PACEs
- **Curriculum Tracking:** Know exactly which PACEs each student is working on
- **Progress Monitoring:** Track when students start and complete PACEs

**PACE Assignment Workflow:**
1. Student enrolled → 2. Assign 4-6 PACEs → 3. Student works through PACEs → 4. Mark PACE complete → 5. Assign next PACE in sequence → 6. Repeat

## Assigning PACEs to Students

### Prerequisites

**Before Assigning PACEs:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Student Must Exist in Zion">
    Add student to roster first
  </Step>

  <Step title="Student Must Be Assigned to Learning Centre">
    Required for supervisor access in Goal Check
  </Step>

  <Step title="Determine Student's Current Level">
    Assessment test, previous records, or grade placement
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Access PACE Assignment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Students">
    Click "Management" → "Students" in sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Student">
    Search or scroll to locate student
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Student Name">
    Opens student detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Assign PACE">
    Or "Manage PACEs" button in Current PACEs section
  </Step>

  <Step title="PACE Catalog Opens">
    Modal shows all 144 PACEs organized by subject and grade
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Selecting Appropriate PACEs

**Standard Load (5-6 PACEs):**
- 1 PACE per core subject
- Example for Grade 5 student:
  - Math 1015 (5th Math PACE, Grade 1 level)
  - English 1025
  - Science 1035
  - Social Studies 1045
  - Word Building 1055

**Light Load (3-4 PACEs):**
- For younger students (Grades 1-2)
- For struggling students
- During transitional periods
- Example: Math, English, Science only

**Heavy Load (7-8 PACEs):**
- For advanced students
- High school students (Grades 9-12)
- Students working on multiple years simultaneously
- Example: 5 core subjects + 2 electives

### PACE Selection Best Practices

**Match to Student Level:**
- **Below Grade Level:** If student struggling, start with previous grade&apos;s PACEs
- **At Grade Level:** Most students start with PACEs matching their grade
- **Above Grade Level:** Advanced students can work above grade level

**Example Scenarios:**

**Student: Grade 5, Reading Below Level**
- Math 1015 (Grade 1 level, matches grade)
- English 1014 (Grade 1, PACE 1014 - one behind to build confidence)
- Science 1035 (Grade 1 level, matches grade)
- Social Studies 1045 (Grade 1 level, matches grade)

**Student: Grade 5, Advanced in All Subjects**
- Math 1027 (Grade 2 level, advanced)
- English 1037 (Grade 2 level, advanced)
- Science 1047 (Grade 2 level, advanced)
- Social Studies 1057 (Grade 2 level, advanced)

**Student: Grade 5, Mixed Abilities**
- Math 1027 (Grade 2 - advanced in math)
- English 1015 (Grade 1 - at level)
- Science 1035 (Grade 1 - at level)
- Social Studies 1013 (Grade 1, behind - needs support)

<Tip>
**Individualization is Key:** The beauty of ACE is every student can work at their own level in each subject. Don&apos;t force all students to be on same PACEs.

## Managing Existing PACE Assignments

### Viewing Student's Current PACEs

**Student Detail Page:**
- **Current PACEs** section shows all assigned PACEs
- For each PACE:
  - PACE number and title (e.g., "1015 - Math")
  - Start date (when assigned)
  - Status (In Progress, Completed, Not Started)
  - Completion % (if tracking enabled)

**Filtering Students by PACE:**
- In Students list, filter by "PACE Number"
- Example: Show all students working on PACE 1015
- Useful for group instruction planning

### Removing PACE Assignments

**When to Remove:**
- Student completed PACE (before assigning next one)
- PACE assigned incorrectly (wrong level)
- Student withdrawn (cleaning up assignments)

**How to Remove:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Student Profile">
    Click student name from Students list
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Manage PACEs">
    In Current PACEs section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find PACE to Remove">
    Assigned PACEs show with "Remove" button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Remove">
    PACE unassigned from student
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Action">
    Read warning (removing PACE doesn&apos;t delete historical Goal Check data)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    PACE removed from student&apos;s profile
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Historical Data Preserved:** Removing a PACE assignment doesn&apos;t delete past Goal Check entries for that PACE. Historical data remains intact for reporting purposes.
</Warning>

## PACE Progression and Completion

### When Student Completes a PACE

**Indicators of Completion:**
- Student finished all 36 pages (or PACE length)
- Passed PACE test/checkup
- Supervisor verifies completion

**Marking PACE as Complete (Future Feature):**
Currently manual tracking. Planned feature: Auto-complete when progress reaches final page.

**Next Steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Completion">
    Check PACE test score, ensure student passed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Record Completion Date">
    Note in student profile when PACE completed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove Completed PACE">
    Unassign completed PACE from student
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Next PACE in Sequence">
    Example: Student completed 1015, assign 1016
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notify Supervisor">
    Ensure supervisor knows student has new PACE
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Goal Check Next Day">
    Goals will show new PACE starting tomorrow
  </Step>
</Steps>

### PACE Sequence Progression

**Sequential Progression (Standard):**
- Student completes PACEs in order: 1001 → 1002 → 1003 → etc.
- Cannot skip PACEs (builds on previous knowledge)
- Complete all 12 PACEs in subject to finish grade level

**Example: Math Progression for Grade 1**
```
Start: 1001 (Math PACE 1)
  ↓ Complete
Assign: 1002 (Math PACE 2)
  ↓ Complete
Assign: 1003 (Math PACE 3)
  ↓ ... Continue through ...
Assign: 1012 (Math PACE 12 - Final for Grade 1 Math)
  ↓ Complete
Assign: 1013 (Math PACE 1 of Grade 2)
```

**Reviewing/Repeating PACEs:**
If student struggling or failed PACE test:
- Option 1: Review same PACE (mark incomplete, continue working)
- Option 2: Assign previous PACE for review
- Option 3: Provide intervention, then re-attempt

### Tracking PACE Completion Rate

**Individual Student Tracking:**
- Count PACEs completed this term
- Typical rate: 1-2 PACEs per subject per term
- Example: 5 subjects × 1.5 PACEs each = 7-8 PACEs per term

**School-Wide Tracking:**
- Export Goal Check data to see PACE completion patterns
- Identify subjects moving slowly (may need review or support)
- Identify fast-moving students (may need enrichment)

## PACE Assignment Strategies

### Grade-Level Appropriate Assignments

**Primary Grades (1-3):**
- Start with 3-4 PACEs (lighter load)
- Focus on foundational subjects: Math, English, Science
- Add Word Building as reading improves
- Social Studies optional for very young students

**Elementary Grades (4-6):**
- Standard 5-6 PACEs (all core subjects)
- Math, English, Science, Social Studies, Word Building
- Most students handle full load

**Junior High (7-9):**
- Full 5-6 PACE load
- May add electives (7-8 PACEs for motivated students)
- Begin preparing for high school

**High School (10-12):**
- 6-8 PACEs typical
- Core subjects + electives
- Accelerated students may work on 2 grade levels simultaneously

### Mixed-Ability Class Management

**Scenario:** One centre with students in Grades 3-5.

**Strategy:**
- Each student works at individual level in each subject
- Student A (Grade 3, at level): PACEs 1025-1035 range
- Student B (Grade 4, advanced): PACEs 1037-1047 range (Grade 2 level)
- Student C (Grade 5, struggling): PACEs 1013-1023 range (Grade 1 level)

**Benefit:**
- Truly individualized instruction
- Students progress at own pace
- No "waiting" for class to catch up or "falling behind"

### Term Planning

**Start of Term:**
- Assign PACEs students will begin term with
- Typically continue from where they left off previous term
- Or start fresh if new academic year

**Mid-Term PACE Change:**
- As students complete PACEs, assign next in sequence
- Most students complete 1-2 PACEs per subject per term
- Some subjects move faster than others (normal)

**End of Term:**
- Students may be mid-PACE (that&apos;s okay!)
- They continue same PACEs next term
- No need to complete all PACEs by term-end

---

## Bulk PACE Management

### Assigning Same PACEs to Multiple Students

**Use Case:**
New term starts, all Grade 5 students in Faith Centre need same starting PACEs.

**Process (Manual):**
1. Create "PACE template" list (e.g., 1015, 1025, 1035, 1045, 1055)
2. Assign to first student
3. Reference template for next students
4. Repeat for all students

**Time Required:** 2-3 minutes per student × 20 students = 40-60 minutes

<Note>
**Bulk Assignment Feature (Planned):** Future version will allow assigning same PACE set to multiple students at once. This will reduce time from 40 minutes to 5 minutes for 20 students.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting PACE Assignments

### "Cannot Set Goals - Student Has No PACEs"

**Cause:**
Student exists but has no PACE assignments.

**Solution:**
Assign 4-6 PACEs to student before attempting Goal Check.

### "Student Working on Wrong PACE Level"

**Symptoms:**
- Student consistently missing goals in one subject
- Or student consistently exceeding goals in one subject

**Diagnosis:**
- Missing goals → PACE too difficult → Assign previous PACE or lower grade level
- Exceeding goals → PACE too easy → Assign next PACE or higher grade level

### "Student Completed PACE But Still Appears in Goal Check"

**Cause:**
PACE not yet removed from student&apos;s assignments.

**Solution:**
1. Remove completed PACE from assignments
2. Assign next PACE in sequence
3. Starting tomorrow, Goal Check will show new PACE

### "PACE Assignment Disappeared"

**Unlikely - But Check:**
1. Student profile still shows PACE? (view student detail)
2. Another administrator may have removed it
3. Check audit log to see who made changes

**Restore:**
Re-assign the PACE to student.

## PACE Assignment Best Practices

### Initial Assessment

**New Students:**
- Don&apos;t assume grade = PACE level
- Conduct placement assessment
- Start conservative (slightly easier PACEs)
- Adjust after 1-2 weeks based on performance

**Returning Students:**
- Continue from where they left off previous term
- Review last term&apos;s completion rates
- Adjust if necessary (student may need different level now)

### Regular Review

**Monthly PACE Review:**
- Check each student&apos;s PACE progression
- Are they advancing appropriately? (1-2 PACEs per term per subject)
- Are they stuck? (same PACE for 4+ weeks)
- Do they need intervention or PACE change?

**Term-End PACE Review:**
- How many PACEs did student complete this term?
- Which subjects progressed fastest?
- Which subjects need support next term?
- Should student be promoted to next grade level?

### Communication with Supervisors

**Notify Supervisors When:**
- Assigning PACEs to new student in their centre
- Changing student&apos;s PACE assignments mid-term
- Student completes PACE (new PACE assigned)

**Template Email:**
```
Subject: PACE Assignment Update for [Student Name]

Hi [Supervisor Name],

I&apos;ve updated PACE assignments for [Student Name]:

Completed:
- Math 1015 (Grade 1, PACE 5)

Newly Assigned:
- Math 1016 (Grade 1, PACE 6)

Please ensure student has new PACE and set goals starting tomorrow.

Thanks,
[Administrator Name]
```
