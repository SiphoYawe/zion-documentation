# CSV Bulk Student Import

Import large student rosters efficiently using CSV file upload. This guide covers template download, data preparation, validation, error handling, and successful import completion.

## When to Use CSV Bulk Import

**Recommended For:**
- Initial school setup (50-200 students)
- Start of academic year (new cohort)
- Transferring from another system
- 20+ students at once

**Time Savings:**
- Manual entry: 2-3 minutes × 50 students = 100-150 minutes
- CSV import: 10-15 minutes total (including prep)
- **Saves 1.5-2 hours for 50 students**

**Not Recommended For:**
- Adding 1-10 students (faster to add individually)
- Students with unique circumstances requiring manual attention
- When you don&apos;t have digital student data

## Step 2: Prepare Your CSV Data

### Opening the Template

**In Excel:**
1. Right-click downloaded template
2. Select "Open with" → "Microsoft Excel"
3. Data should appear in columns

**In Google Sheets:**
1. Go to sheets.google.com
2. File → Import
3. Upload → Select template file
4. Import as new spreadsheet

### Filling Out Student Data

**For Each Student (One Row):**

**first_name (Required):**
- Legal first name only (no nicknames)
- Example: "John" not "Johnny"
- No special characters unless part of legal name

**last_name (Required):**
- Legal last name
- Example: "Smith"
- Hyphenated names okay: "Smith-Jones"

**date_of_birth (Required):**
- **CRITICAL: Use YYYY-MM-DD format**
- Example: 2013-03-15 (March 15, 2013)
- NOT 03/15/2013 or 15/03/2013
- Excel may auto-format dates - check before saving!

**grade_level (Required):**
- Number only: 1, 2, 3, ... 12
- NOT "Grade 5" or "Fifth Grade"
- Example: 5

**learning_centre_name (Required):**
- **CRITICAL: Must match existing centre name exactly**
- Case-sensitive: "Faith Centre" ≠ "faith centre"
- No extra spaces: "Faith Centre" ≠ "Faith Centre "
- Get exact names from Zion (Management → Learning Centres)

**student_id (Optional):**
- Your internal school ID
- Any format works: "2024-001", "STU-12345"
- Must be unique (no two students with same ID)

**parent_name (Optional):**
- Full name of parent/guardian
- Example: "Jane Smith"

**parent_email (Optional):**
- Valid email format
- Example: jane@example.com
- Used for future parent portal

**parent_phone (Optional):**
- Include country code for international
- Example: +256701234567 (Uganda), +1-555-123-4567 (USA)
- Can include or omit dashes/spaces

**notes (Optional):**
- Any relevant information
- Medical info, accommodations, etc.
- Keep brief (1-2 sentences)

### Data Quality Tips

**Before Saving:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Date Format">
    Ensure all dates are YYYY-MM-DD (Excel often changes this!)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Centre Names">
    Copy exact names from Zion to avoid typos
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove Empty Rows">
    Delete any blank rows at bottom
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for Duplicates">
    Sort by name, look for duplicate students
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Grade Levels">
    All grades should be 1-12 (numbers only)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Date format wrong (most common error!)
- Learning centre name doesn&apos;t match exactly
- Grade level as text ("Grade 5") instead of number (5)
- Extra commas in notes field (breaks CSV format)
- Blank required fields

## Step 3: Save and Upload CSV

### Saving Your CSV File

**In Excel:**
1. File → Save As
2. Choose location (Desktop for easy finding)
3. **CRITICAL: Select "CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)" as format**
4. Name file: "students-import-2024.csv"
5. Click Save
6. Excel may warn "Some features not compatible" - click Yes/OK

**In Google Sheets:**
1. File → Download
2. Select "Comma Separated Values (.csv)"
3. File downloads to Downloads folder
4. Rename if desired: "students-import-2024.csv"

<Warning>
**Excel Date Warning:** Excel often changes date format when saving CSV. After saving, re-open CSV in Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac) to verify dates are still YYYY-MM-DD format. If not, you&apos;ll need to fix in Excel and re-save.
</Warning>

### Uploading to Zion

<Steps>
  <Step title="Return to Zion Import Page">
    Management → Students → Import Students
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Choose File or Drag/Drop">
    Select your saved CSV file
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Upload">
    File uploads (5-10 seconds for 50 students)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validation Begins Automatically">
    Zion checks data immediately after upload
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 4: Validation and Error Handling

### Validation Process

**Zion Checks:**
1. **File Format:** Is it valid CSV?
2. **Required Columns:** Are all 5 required columns present?
3. **Data Types:** Are dates valid? Grades 1-12? Emails formatted correctly?
4. **Learning Centres:** Do all centre names match existing centres?
5. **Duplicates:** Any duplicate student IDs or exact name+DOB matches?
6. **Logical Errors:** Age appropriate for grade? Future dates of birth?

**Validation Results:**

**All Valid (Green):**
```
✓ 50 students validated successfully
✓ 0 errors found
Ready to import!
```

**Some Errors (Red):**
```
✗ 45 students validated successfully
✗ 5 students have errors
Review errors below and fix your CSV
```

### Common Validation Errors

**Error: "Invalid date format"**
- **Cause:** Date not in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Example:** "03/15/2013" should be "2013-03-15"
- **Fix:** Open CSV, correct date format, re-save, re-upload

**Error: "Learning centre not found"**
- **Cause:** Centre name doesn&apos;t match exactly
- **Example:** CSV says "faith centre" but Zion has "Faith Centre" (case mismatch)
- **Fix:** Copy exact centre name from Zion, paste into CSV, re-save, re-upload

**Error: "Grade level must be between 1 and 12"**
- **Cause:** Grade is text or out of range
- **Example:** "Grade 5" should be "5", or "13" is invalid
- **Fix:** Change to number 1-12

**Error: "Invalid email format"**
- **Cause:** Email missing @ or domain
- **Example:** "janeemail.com" should be "jane@email.com"
- **Fix:** Correct email format

**Error: "Duplicate student found"**
- **Cause:** Same first name + last name + date of birth as existing student
- **Example:** Already have "John Smith" born 2013-03-15
- **Fix:** If truly different student, add middle initial or nickname to differentiate. If duplicate, remove from CSV.

**Error: "Required field missing"**
- **Cause:** One of the 5 required columns is blank
- **Example:** Student 15 has no first_name
- **Fix:** Fill in missing data, re-save, re-upload

### Viewing Error Details

**Error Display:**
```
Row 15: Invalid date format in date_of_birth
  Student: John Smith
  Value entered: 03/15/2013
  Expected format: YYYY-MM-DD (2013-03-15)

Row 22: Learning centre not found
  Student: Mary Johnson
  Value entered: "faith centre"
  Available centres: Faith Centre, Grace Centre, Hope Centre
```

**Download Error Report:**
1. Click "Download Error Report" button
2. CSV file downloads with errors highlighted
3. Fix errors in this file
4. Re-upload

---

## Step 5: Confirm Import

### Review Import Preview

**When Validation Passes:**
- Zion shows preview of first 10 students to be imported
- Review to ensure data looks correct
- Check names, grades, centres are as expected

**Import Summary:**
```
Ready to Import:
- 50 students
- Into 3 learning centres (Faith: 20, Grace: 18, Hope: 12)
- Grades 1-12
- 45 with parent email, 5 without
```

### Executing Import

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Summary">
    Verify student count matches expectation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Import X Students Button">
    Button shows exact count (e.g., "Import 50 Students")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Import">
    Progress bar shows 10-30 seconds for 50 students
  </Step>

  <Step title="Success Message">
    "50 students imported successfully!"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Students List">
    Click "View Students" to see new entries
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Verifying Import Success

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Total Count">
    Students list should show increased count
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter by Centre">
    Verify students in correct centres
  </Step>

  <Step title="Spot-Check Random Students">
    Click few students to verify data imported correctly
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for Missing Students">
    If count doesn&apos;t match, some students may not have imported (check error log)
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 6: Post-Import Tasks

### Assign PACEs to All Students

**Immediately After Import:**
Students have NO PACE assignments after CSV import (too individualized to import via CSV).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Filter Students">
    Filter to newly imported students (by date added)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign PACEs Student-by-Student">
    Click each student, assign 4-6 PACEs based on grade
  </Step>

  <Step title="Or Batch Assign">
    For students of same grade, assign similar PACEs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify All Have PACEs">
    Check that all imported students now have PACE assignments
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes for 50 students

**See [PACE Assignments Guide](/features/students/pace-assignments) for details.**

### Notify Supervisors

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: New Students Assigned to [Centre Name]

Hi [Supervisor Name],

I&apos;ve just imported [X] new students into Zion and assigned them to your centre ([Centre Name]).

Students added:
- [List student names and grades]

Please verify:
1. Students appear in your Goal Check entry
2. PACE assignments are appropriate
3. All student information is correct

Let me know if you have questions or need changes.

Thanks,
[Administrator Name]
```

## Advanced CSV Import Features

### Updating Existing Students via CSV

**Use Case:**
Update multiple students&apos; information at once (e.g., change grades at start of year).

**How It Works:**
1. Export existing students as CSV (Data Export feature)
2. Modify CSV (change grades, centres, etc.)
3. Upload modified CSV
4. Zion matches by student_id or name+DOB
5. Updates existing records instead of creating duplicates

**Caution:**
This feature is powerful but can overwrite data. Test with small batch first.

### Partial Imports

**Use Case:**
Import fails validation for 5 of 50 students.

**Options:**

**Option 1: Fix and Re-Import All**
- Fix 5 errors in CSV
- Re-upload entire CSV
- Zion skips duplicates, imports only new students

**Option 2: Remove Invalid Rows and Import Valid Only**
- Delete 5 error rows from CSV
- Import 45 valid students
- Later, manually add 5 problematic students individually

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (fix and re-import) for completeness.

## Troubleshooting CSV Import

### "CSV Upload Failed"

**Causes:**
1. File too large (>5MB)
2. File not actually CSV format (saved as Excel .xlsx)
3. Internet connection lost during upload

**Solutions:**
1. Split CSV into smaller files (import in batches)
2. Re-save as .csv (not .xlsx)
3. Check internet, re-upload

### "All Students Failing Validation with Same Error"

**Common Cause:**
Column headers wrong or missing.

**Check:**
- First row should be: `first_name,last_name,date_of_birth,grade_level,learning_centre_name,...`
- No extra header rows above this
- Column names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Fix:**
Re-download template, copy your data into it (don&apos;t modify headers).

### "Validation Says 50 Success But Only 45 Imported"

**Cause:**
5 students already exist (duplicates detected during import, not validation).

**Verify:**
Check Students list for those 5 names - likely they were already in system.

### "Dates Importing as Numbers"

**Cause:**
Excel saved dates as serial numbers instead of YYYY-MM-DD.

**Example:**
CSV shows "44981" instead of "2023-01-15"

**Fix:**
1. Open CSV in Notepad/TextEdit (not Excel)
2. Check date format visually
3. If numbers, go back to Excel
4. Format date columns as "Text" BEFORE entering dates
5. Re-enter dates as YYYY-MM-DD
6. Re-save as CSV

## CSV Import Best Practices

### Before Import

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Backup">
    If updating existing students, export current data first (safety net)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test with Small Batch">
    Import 5-10 students first to verify format works
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Centre Names">
    List all centres in Zion, copy names exactly into CSV
  </Step>

  <Step title="Standardize Data">
    Use consistent formats (dates, phone numbers, etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### During Import

<Steps>
  <Step title="Don&apos;t Close Browser">
    Keep Zion tab open during validation and import
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Validation Carefully">
    Even if only 1 error, fix it (incomplete data causes issues later)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Error Report">
    Download error CSV for records
  </Step>
</Steps>

### After Import

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Count">
    Expected students = imported students?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign PACEs Immediately">
    Don&apos;t delay - students can&apos;t use Goal Check without PACEs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notify Supervisors">
    Inform supervisors of new students in their centres
  </Step>

  <Step title="Spot-Check Data">
    Review random students to ensure data imported correctly
  </Step>
</Steps>

## CSV Import FAQs

**Q: Can I import students without learning centre assignments?**
A: No, `learning_centre_name` is required. All students must be assigned to a centre.

**Q: What happens if I upload the same CSV twice?**
A: Zion detects duplicates (same name+DOB) and skips them. Won&apos;t create duplicate entries.

**Q: Can I import PACE assignments via CSV?**
A: Not yet. PACE assignments too individualized for bulk import. Assign manually after import.

**Q: Maximum students per CSV import?**
A: 500 students per import. For larger schools, split into multiple CSVs.

**Q: Can I update existing students via CSV?**
A: Yes, advanced feature. Match by student_id, update fields. Use with caution.

**Q: What if my CSV has extra columns?**
A: Extra columns are ignored. Only recognized columns are processed.

**Q: Can I import to multiple centres in one CSV?**
A: Yes! Each row can specify different learning centre.
