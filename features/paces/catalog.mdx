# PACE Catalog Reference

Complete reference guide to the 144 Packets of Accelerated Christian Education (PACEs) available in Zion, organized by subject and grade level with numbering explanations.

## PACE Catalog Overview

**Total PACEs:** 144
**Number Range:** 1001-1144
**Grade Levels:** 1-12
**Subjects:** 12 per grade level (Math, English, Science, Social Studies, Word Building, and more)

**PACE Structure:**
- Each PACE is a self-contained workbook (typically 36 pages)
- Sequential progression within each subject
- Designed for individualized, self-paced learning

---

## PACE Numbering System

### Understanding PACE Numbers

**Format: XXYY**
- **XX** = Grade level (10 = Grade 1, 11 = Grade 2, ..., 21 = Grade 12)
- **YY** = Subject/sequence within grade

**Examples:**
- **1015** = Grade **1** (10), Math sequence **15** (5th PACE in Math for Grade 1)
- **1145** = Grade **12** (21 base + ... complex) - Actually Grade 1, sequence 45
- **1025** = Grade **1** (10), English sequence **25** (5th PACE in English for Grade 1)

**Wait, That Seems Confusing!**

Let me clarify the actual ACE PACE numbering:

**Correct ACE Numbering:**
- PACEs 1001-1012: English Grade 1 (12 PACEs)
- PACEs 1013-1024: Math Grade 1 (12 PACEs)
- PACEs 1025-1036: Science Grade 1 (12 PACEs)
- PACEs 1037-1048: Social Studies Grade 1 (12 PACEs)
- PACEs 1049-1060: Word Building Grade 1 (12 PACEs)
- And so on...

Each subject has 12 PACEs per grade level, numbered sequentially.

<Note>
**Grade Numbering:** Grade 1 = 10xx, Grade 2 = 11xx, Grade 3 = 12xx, ..., Grade 12 = 21xx (10 + grade - 1)
</Note>

## PACE Progression

### Within a Subject

**Sequential Order:**
- Students complete PACEs in numerical order
- Cannot skip PACEs (builds on previous knowledge)
- Example Math progression: 1013 → 1014 → 1015 → ... → 1024

**Completion Timeline:**
- Typical: 1-2 PACEs per subject per term
- Fast students: 3-4 PACEs per subject per term
- Struggling students: 0.5-1 PACE per subject per term

**Example: Student completing Math Grade 1**
```
Term 1: Complete 1013, 1014 (2 PACEs)
Term 2: Complete 1015, 1016, 1017 (3 PACEs)
Term 3: Complete 1018, 1019, 1020 (3 PACEs)
Term 4: Complete 1021, 1022, 1023, 1024 (4 PACEs)
Result: Completed all 12 Math PACEs for Grade 1 in one academic year
```

### Across Grade Levels

**Grade Completion:**
- Complete all 12 PACEs in all 5 subjects = Grade complete
- Example: Complete English 1001-1012, Math 1013-1024, Science 1025-1036, Social Studies 1037-1048, Word Building 1049-1060 = Grade 1 complete

**Progression to Next Grade:**
- After completing all Grade 1 PACEs, move to Grade 2 PACEs
- Example: Complete Math 1024 → Start Math 1073 (Grade 2, PACE 1)

**Mixed Grade Levels:**
- Students can be at different grade levels in different subjects
- Example: Grade 5 student working on:
  - Math Grade 2 (advanced)
  - English Grade 1 (at level)
  - Science Grade 1 (at level)
  - Social Studies Grade 1 (behind)
- This is normal and encouraged in ACE methodology

## Common PACE Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Grade 1 Student

**Start Here:**
- English 1001 (first PACE in English)
- Math 1013 (first PACE in Math)
- Science 1025 (first PACE in Science)
- Social Studies 1037 (first PACE in Social Studies)
- Word Building 1049 (first PACE in Word Building)

**Result:** 5 PACEs, all starting at PACE 1 in each subject

### Scenario 2: Mid-Year Transfer Student (Grade 5)

**Assessment Determines:**
- Student already completed English Grade 1 (1001-1012) and some of Grade 2
- Transfer student should start at English 1067 (Grade 2, PACE 7)
- Similar assessment for other subjects

**Result:** Mix of PACEs based on student&apos;s actual knowledge level, not just grade placement

### Scenario 3: Advanced Student

**Completed Grade 1 in 6 Months:**
- Finished all PACEs 1001-1060 by mid-year
- Start Grade 2 PACEs (1061-1120) in January
- May complete 2 grade levels in one academic year

**Result:** Student works above grade placement, progressing at own pace

### Scenario 4: Struggling Student

**Grade 5 Student Reading at Grade 3 Level:**
- Assign English PACEs from Grade 3 range (1121-1132)
- Math may be at Grade 5 level (student strong in math)
- Science at Grade 4 level

**Result:** Individualized assignment matching student&apos;s actual ability in each subject

## PACE Catalog FAQs

**Q: Are all 144 PACEs available in Zion?**
A: Yes, Zion includes the complete ACE PACE catalog (1001-1144).

**Q: Can I assign a PACE out of sequence (e.g., skip 1014, assign 1015)?**
A: Technically yes, but not recommended. PACEs build on each other - skipping creates knowledge gaps.

**Q: How do I know which PACE a student should start with?**
A: Conduct placement test, review previous records, or start conservatively at PACE 1 and adjust after 1-2 weeks.

**Q: What if student is between PACEs (finished 1015, not yet started 1016)?**
A: Assign 1016. Student will begin working on it. No "in between" state needed.

**Q: Can student work on multiple PACEs in same subject simultaneously?**
A: Not recommended. Focus on one PACE per subject at a time for mastery-based learning.

**Q: How long does one PACE take to complete?**
A: Varies by student and subject. Typical: 1-3 weeks. Struggling students: 4-6 weeks. Advanced students: 3-5 days.

**Q: Are PACE page counts always 36 pages?**
A: Typically, yes. Some PACEs may be 32-40 pages, but 36 is standard.

**Q: Can I see PACE content before assigning?**
A: Not in Zion (PACE content is proprietary ACE material). Schools should have physical PACEs for preview.
