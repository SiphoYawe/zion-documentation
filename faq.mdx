## Getting Started

### How long does setup take?

**Quickstart:** 15 minutes to get operational
**Complete Setup:** 30-60 minutes for full school configuration

Our guided onboarding wizard walks you through every step.

### Can I import my existing student roster?

Yes! Zion supports CSV bulk import. Simply download our template, fill in your student data, and upload. We&apos;ll validate and import all students at once.

### Do I need special equipment?

No special equipment required! Zion works on:
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox)
- Desktop computers
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)
- Mobile phones (limited functionality)

We recommend tablets for Goal Check entry (easy on-the-go data entry).

## Goal Check

### Do I have to set goals every single day?

For best results, yes. But it only takes 5 minutes with our "Copy Previous Day" feature. Goal Check intelligence requires consistent daily data.

### What if I forget to set goals one morning?

You can set goals anytime - even retroactively for past dates. Students can work from their PACEs while you enter goals.

### What if a student completes different pages than their goal?

That&apos;s perfectly fine! Enter the actual pages they completed. Zion calculates the variance (difference between goal and actual), which helps you adjust future goals and identify trends.

### Can I edit goals after setting them?

Yes, goals are editable until you mark progress. Just go back to "Set Goals" and update.

### How do I know which students need intervention?

Check the "At-Risk Alerts" section on your dashboard. Zion automatically flags students who:
- Miss goals 3+ consecutive days
- Show declining trend (>20% drop over 2 weeks)
- Consistently struggle in specific subjects

## Reports

### When can I generate daily centre reports?

Daily centre reports can only be generated when **all students in that centre are marked** for the day. The readiness indicator shows "Ready (X/X students marked)" when you can generate.

### How long do reports take to generate?

**Daily Centre Report:** <30 seconds  
**Weekly School Report:** <1 minute for 200-student school

Large reports (>100 students) may be processed as background jobs with email notification.

### Can I access historical reports?

Yes! All generated reports are saved to your report history. You can view, download, or regenerate any past report.

### What formats are reports available in?

All reports export in:
- **PDF:** Professional format for printing/sharing
- **CSV:** Excel-compatible for custom analysis

## Users & Permissions

**Administrator:**
- Full school access
- Manage settings, users, students
- View all data
- Generate school-wide reports

**Supervisor:**
- Assigned learning centres only
- Set goals and mark progress
- Generate centre reports
- View centre-scoped dashboard

**Monitor:**
- Assigned learning centres only

**Student/Parent:** *(Coming in Phase 2)*

### Can supervisors access multiple centres?

Yes! Supervisors can be assigned to multiple learning centres. They&apos;ll see combined data for all assigned centres.

### Can I change a user&apos;s role after inviting them?

Yes, administrators can edit user roles anytime. The user must log out and back in for changes to take effect.

### What happens when I deactivate a user?

Deactivation prevents login but preserves all historical data and audit trails. You can reactivate users anytime.

---

## Students & PACEs

### How many PACEs can a student be assigned?

Students can have unlimited PACE assignments, but typically 4-6 PACEs (one per subject) is standard for individualized learning.

### Can I assign the same PACE to multiple students?

Absolutely! The PACE catalog is shared across all students. Each assignment is independent.

### What happens to student data when they graduate?

When you deactivate a student (graduated/withdrawn), all their historical data is preserved for records and reporting. Deactivated students don&apos;t appear in active lists but remain in historical reports.

### Can I track PACE completion percentage?

Currently, Zion tracks daily goal pages. PACE completion tracking is planned for a future update.

Zion works on all modern browsers:
- Google Chrome (recommended)
- Safari (iOS and macOS)

### Does Zion work offline?
