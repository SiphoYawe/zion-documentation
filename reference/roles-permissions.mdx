## Permission Boundaries

### What Supervisors CANNOT Do

Even though supervisors have significant access, they **cannot**:
-  Create or edit learning centres
-  Invite or manage other staff
-  Add or remove students from the school
-  Reassign students to different centres
-  Change school settings (timezone, logo, etc.)
-  Generate weekly school reports
-  Export raw Goal Check data
-  See students from other centres

**Why These Limits:**
- Maintains data security and privacy
- Prevents accidental system-wide changes
- Focuses supervisors on their centres only
- Reserves strategic functions for administrators

### What Monitors CANNOT Do

Monitors have the most restricted access:
-  Generate any reports (daily or weekly)
-  Access any dashboards or analytics
-  Manage students or PACEs
-  See historical trends or patterns
-  Export data

**Why These Limits:**
- Keeps interface simple for data entry focus
- Prevents information overload
- Reserves analysis to supervisors and administrators
- Ideal for part-time or assistant staff

## Role Assignment Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Role

**Use Administrator for:**
- School leadership responsible for whole-school decisions
- Staff managing all learning centres
- Personnel handling system configuration
- Users needing weekly school reports

**Use Supervisor for:**
- Full-time learning centre teachers
- Staff responsible for daily centre management
- Personnel who need centre dashboards and daily reports
- Users managing students in their centre

**Use Monitor for:**
- Part-time teaching assistants
- Volunteer helpers with data entry tasks
- Staff who only need to enter Goal Check data
- Users who don&apos;t need analytics or reporting

### Common Role Assignment Scenarios

**Small School (50 students, 3 centres):**
- 1 Administrator (Principal)
- 3 Supervisors (one per centre)
- 1-2 Monitors (float between centres as needed)

**Medium School (150 students, 6 centres):**
- 2 Administrators (Principal + Academic Director)
- 6 Supervisors (one per centre)
- 3-4 Monitors (support various centres)

**Large School (300 students, 12 centres):**
- 3 Administrators (Principal + 2 Academic Directors)
- 12-15 Supervisors (1-2 per centre)
- 6-8 Monitors (support across centres)

---

## Security & Data Privacy

### Data Access Principles

**Need-to-Know Basis:**
- Users only see data necessary for their role
- Supervisors don&apos;t see other centres (prevents comparison, maintains privacy)
- Monitors don&apos;t see analytics (focus on data entry)

**Audit Trail:**
- All actions tracked with user name and timestamp
- Shows who set goals, who marked progress, who generated reports
- Immutable history for accountability

**Role Changes:**
- When role changes (Supervisor → Monitor), access adjusts immediately
- Historical data shows what role user had when action was performed
- No data is deleted when roles change

### Recommended Policies

**DO:**
- Review staff access quarterly (deactivate unused accounts)
- Use least-privilege principle (don&apos;t make everyone administrator)
- Document who has which role and why
- Train staff on their role limitations

**DON&apos;T:**
- Share login credentials between staff
- Give administrator access unless truly needed
- Keep deactivated staff accounts active "just in case"
- Make monitors into supervisors just to see dashboards
