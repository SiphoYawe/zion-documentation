# ACE & Zion Terminology Reference

Comprehensive glossary of terms used in ACE (Accelerated Christian Education) methodology and Zion school management system.

## ACE Methodology Terms

### PACE

**Definition:**
Packet of Accelerated Christian Education. Self-contained workbook covering specific topic or unit in a subject.

**Details:**
- Typically 36 pages
- Includes instruction, exercises, self-tests, and final checkup
- Sequentially numbered (1001-1144 across all grades and subjects)
- Designed for self-paced, individualized learning

**Example:**
PACE 1015 is the 3rd Math PACE for Grade 1 students.

**See Also:** [PACE Catalog](/features/paces/catalog)

---

### Goal Check

**Definition:**
Daily accountability system where students set page completion goals each morning and supervisors check actual progress at end of day.

**In Traditional ACE:**
- Manual tracking on whiteboards or paper
- 2-3 hours daily for compilation and reporting
- Limited analytics or trend analysis

**In Zion:**
- Digital goal setting (5 minutes)
- Automated progress tracking
- Real-time dashboards
- One-click reports (<30 seconds)

**Components:**
1. Morning: Set goals (start page, end page)
2. Throughout day: Students work toward goals
3. End of day: Mark actual progress (actual start page, actual end page)
4. Calculate variance (actual - goal)
5. Generate reports

**Example:**
Goal: Pages 15-20 (6 pages). Actual: Pages 15-18 (4 pages). Variance: -2 pages (missed goal by 2 pages).

### Learning Centre

**Definition:**
Classroom or learning space in ACE school where students work on PACEs under supervisor guidance.

**Characteristics:**
- Typically 15-30 students per centre
- Mixed grades (e.g., Grades 1-3 together) or single grade

- Supervisor desk for monitoring and assistance

**In Zion:**
- Organizational unit for student assignment

---

### Variance

**Definition:**
Difference between actual pages completed and goal pages set. Key metric for Goal Check performance.

**Formula:**
```
Variance = Actual Total Pages - Goal Total Pages
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Positive (+)**: Student exceeded goal (completed more than planned)
- **Zero (0)**: Student met goal exactly
- **Negative (-)**: Student missed goal (completed fewer than planned)

**Examples:**
- Goal 6 pages, Actual 8 pages = +2 variance (exceeded by 2 pages)
- Goal 6 pages, Actual 6 pages = 0 variance (met exactly)
- Goal 6 pages, Actual 4 pages = -2 variance (missed by 2 pages)

**Uses:**
- Assess if goals are appropriately challenging
- Identify struggling students (consistent negative variance)
- Track student trends over time
- Adjust future goal-setting strategies

**See Also:** [Marking Progress](/features/goal-check/marking-progress)

---

### Completion Rate

**Definition:**
Percentage of students who met or exceeded their daily goals.

**Formula:**
```
Completion Rate = (Students Completed + Students Exceeded) / Total Students Marked × 100
```

**Example:**
- 30 students total
- 25 marked today
- 18 completed, 3 exceeded, 4 missed
- Completion Rate = (18 + 3) / 25 × 100 = 84%

**Targets:**
- **Excellent**: 85%+
- **Good**: 75-84%
- **Fair**: 60-74%
- **Poor**: <60%
