# Monitor Goal Check Workflow

This guide shows monitors how to use Zion for Goal Check data entry. Your role is focused and streamlined: enter goals in the morning and mark actual progress at end of day.

<Note>
**Monitor vs Supervisor:** Monitors focus solely on data entry (setting goals, marking progress). You won&apos;t have access to dashboards, reports, or analytics - those are supervisor features. Your interface is simpler and faster for efficient data collection.
</Note>

## Your Role as Monitor

**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Set daily PACE page goals for students in your assigned centres
- Mark actual pages completed at end of day
- Add notes for students who struggled

**What You Will NOT Do:**
- Generate reports (supervisor function)
- View dashboards or analytics (supervisor function)
- Manage students or PACEs (administrator function)
- Make strategic decisions (supervisor/administrator function)

**Estimated Time:**
- Morning goal entry: 5 minutes for 20 students
- End of day marking: 5 minutes for 20 students
- Total: ~10 minutes per day

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use Goal Check, your administrator must:
1. Invite you as a monitor (you&apos;ll receive email invitation)
2. Assign you to one or more learning centres
3. Ensure students in your centres have PACE assignments

### Accessing Zion

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Your Email">
    Look for invitation email from Zion (via Clerk)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Invitation Link">
    Opens Zion sign-up page with your email pre-filled
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Your Password">
    Create a secure password for your account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log In">
    Use your email and password to access Zion
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Role">
    You&apos;ll see "Monitor" badge in top right corner
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Monitor Interface

**Sidebar Navigation:**
- **Goal Check** - Your primary workflow
  - Set Goals (morning task)
  - Mark Progress (end of day task)
- **Profile** - Update your personal info
- **Help** - Access documentation and support

**What You WON&apos;T See:**
- Dashboard (supervisor only)
- Reports (supervisor/administrator only)
- Students management (administrator only)
- Learning centres management (administrator only)

<Tip>
**Simplified Interface:** Your interface is intentionally simple to keep you focused on data entry. This makes your work faster and reduces cognitive load.
</Tip>

## Morning: Setting Daily Goals

### Step 1: Access Goal Entry

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log Into Zion">
    Use your email and password
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Goal Check">
    In sidebar navigation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Set Goals">
    Opens goal entry interface
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Date">
    Ensure date is today (or select different date if needed)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Understand the Goal Entry Table

**Table Structure:**
- **Rows:** Each row is a student in your assigned centre(s)
- **Column Groups:** Each student has columns for their assigned PACEs
- **Fields per PACE:**
  - Goal Start Page (where they&apos;ll start today)
  - Goal End Page (where they should end today)
  - Goal Total Pages (auto-calculated: end - start + 1)

**Example:**
```
Student: John Smith
PACE: Math 1015

Goal Start Page: 15
Goal End Page: 20
Goal Total Pages: 6 pages (auto-calculated)
```

### Step 3: Enter Goals for Each Student

**For Each Student and PACE:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Goal Start Page">
    Type the page number where student will begin today (e.g., 15)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Goal End Page">
    Type the page number where student should finish today (e.g., 20)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Total Pages">
    System auto-calculates total pages (should be reasonable: 5-10 pages typically)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move to Next PACE">
    Press Tab or click next field to continue
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat for All PACEs">
    Each student typically has 4-6 PACEs
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Auto-Save:**
- Goals save automatically as you type (500ms after you stop typing)
- Checkmarks appear when data is saved
- No "Submit All" button needed - just enter data and navigate away when done

### Step 4: Use Quick Templates (Optional)

**Copy Previous Day:**
1. Click "Copy Previous Day" button at top of page
2. Yesterday&apos;s goals pre-fill for all students
3. Adjust as needed for students who did/didn&apos;t complete goals

**Why Use Copy Previous Day:**
- Saves time (pre-fills all fields)
- Maintains continuity (students pick up where they left off)
- Requires minimal adjustments (only change for students who struggled or excelled)

**Standard Goal Guidelines by Grade:**
- Grades 1-4: 5-6 pages per subject
- Grades 5-8: 7-8 pages per subject
- Grades 9-12: 9-10 pages per subject

These are guidelines - your supervisor may adjust based on student ability and PACE difficulty.

### Step 5: Validation and Error Handling

**Zion Validates Your Entries:**

**Valid Entry:**
- Goal start page ≤ goal end page
- Goal end page ≤ PACE total pages (typically 36)
- All fields numeric (no letters or special characters)

**Invalid Entry Examples:**
- Goal start page 25, goal end page 20 (start > end) - ERROR
- Goal end page 40 (PACE only has 36 pages) - ERROR
- Goal start page "abc" (not a number) - ERROR

**Error Display:**
- Red border around invalid field
- Error message below field
- Cannot save until fixed

**Fix Errors:**
1. Review error message
2. Correct the value
3. Error clears automatically when fixed
4. Data saves when valid

## End of Day: Marking Actual Progress

### Step 1: Access Progress Marking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log Into Zion">
    If not already logged in
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Goal Check">
    In sidebar navigation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Mark Progress">
    Opens progress marking interface
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Date">
    Ensure date is today (or select different date if needed)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Understand the Progress Marking Table

**Table Structure:**
- Same layout as goal entry
- Shows goals you set this morning (read-only)
- Has fields for actual pages completed

**Fields per PACE:**
- Goal Pages (read-only, set this morning)
- Actual Start Page (where student actually started)
- Actual End Page (where student actually finished)
- Actual Total Pages (auto-calculated)
- Variance (actual - goal, auto-calculated)

**Example:**
```
Student: John Smith
PACE: Math 1015

Goal Pages: 6 pages (15-20, set this morning)
Actual Start Page: 15 (enter now)
Actual End Page: 19 (enter now)
Actual Total Pages: 5 pages (auto-calculated)
Variance: -1 page (missed by 1 page)
```

### Step 3: Mark Progress for Each Student

**For Each Student and PACE:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Physical PACE">
    Look at student&apos;s PACE to see which pages they completed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Actual Start Page">
    Type the page number where student actually began work today
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Actual End Page">
    Type the page number where student actually finished work today
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Actual Total Pages">
    System auto-calculates total pages completed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Variance">
    System shows difference between actual and goal (+ or - pages)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move to Next PACE">
    Press Tab or click next field to continue
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Auto-Save:**
- Progress saves automatically as you type
- Checkmarks appear when saved
- Status badge updates (Completed, Missed, Exceeded)

### Step 4: Understanding Variance

**Variance = Actual Total Pages - Goal Total Pages**

**Positive Variance (+pages):**
- Student did MORE than goal
- Example: Goal 6 pages, Actual 8 pages = +2 variance
- Status: "Exceeded" (blue badge)

**Zero Variance (0 pages):**
- Student met goal exactly
- Example: Goal 6 pages, Actual 6 pages = 0 variance
- Status: "Completed" (green badge)

**Negative Variance (-pages):**
- Student did FEWER than goal
- Example: Goal 6 pages, Actual 4 pages = -2 variance
- Status: "Missed" (red badge)

**Color-Coded Badges:**
- **Green "Completed"**: Met or slightly exceeded goal
- **Blue "Exceeded"**: Significantly exceeded goal
- **Red "Missed"**: Did not meet goal

### Step 5: Adding Notes (Optional)

**When to Add Notes:**
- Student missed goal (explain why)
- Student struggled with specific concept
- Student excelled (note what went well)
- External factors affected performance (illness, disruption, etc.)

**How to Add Notes:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Notes Field">
    Below student&apos;s PACE entries
  </Step>

  <Step title="Type Brief Note">
    Example: "Struggled with multiplication tables in pages 15-17"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Automatically">
    Notes auto-save as you type
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Note Guidelines:**
- Keep notes brief (1-2 sentences)
- Be specific about what struggled/excelled
- Include page numbers if relevant
- Avoid vague notes like "did ok" (not helpful for analysis)

**Good Note Examples:**
- "Missed goal due to spelling difficulty in pages 22-24"
- "Exceeded goal - very focused today, completed early"
- "Absent for second half of day, partial completion"

## Best Practices for Monitors

### Goal Setting Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy Previous Day First">
    Start with yesterday&apos;s goals as baseline
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust for Completion">
    If student completed yesterday&apos;s goal, continue from where they left off. If not, repeat same pages.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check with Supervisor">
    If unsure about goal difficulty for a student, ask your supervisor
  </Step>

  <Step title="Be Consistent">
    Set goals at same time each morning (e.g., 8:00 AM before students arrive)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Double-Check Entries">
    Glance through entries before navigating away to catch typos
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Progress Marking Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mark Daily">
    Don&apos;t let marking pile up - daily marking is crucial for accurate tracking
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Physical PACEs">
    Look at actual PACEs to see what students completed (don&apos;t guess)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Be Honest">
    Enter actual pages completed, not what you wish they completed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Notes for Struggles">
    Always note why student missed goal (helps supervisor plan support)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark Consistently">
    Same time each afternoon (e.g., 3:00 PM after students finish)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Time Management Tips

**Morning Goal Entry (5 min for 20 students):**
- Use "Copy Previous Day" to save time
- Only adjust for students who struggled/excelled yesterday
- Work in batches: All Math goals, then all English goals, etc.

**Afternoon Progress Marking (5 min for 20 students):**
- Have all PACEs collected before starting
- Work student-by-student (mark all PACEs for one student, then move to next)
- Add notes as you go (don&apos;t save notes for end)

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I make a mistake entering goals?**
A: Goals are editable until you mark progress. Just go back to Set Goals and correct the entry.

**Q: Can I set goals for past dates?**
A: Yes, if you forgot to set goals yesterday, you can select past date and enter goals. Same for marking progress.

**Q: What if a student was absent?**
A: Set goals anyway (for record-keeping), then at end of day, mark 0 pages completed (leave actual start/end blank or enter 0).

**Q: Student completed different pages than goal - is that okay?**
A: Yes! Enter the actual pages they completed. Variance will reflect the difference. This is normal and expected.

**Q: How do I know if my data saved?**
A: Look for green checkmarks next to fields. If no checkmark, data may not have saved - check internet connection.

**Q: Can I see reports of the data I entered?**
A: No, monitors don&apos;t have access to reports. Your supervisor generates reports using the data you enter.

**Q: What if I don&apos;t know what goal pages to set?**
A: Use "Copy Previous Day" or ask your supervisor for guidance. They can provide standard templates for your students.

**Q: Student completed a different PACE than assigned - what do I do?**
A: Contact your supervisor. They can adjust PACE assignments. Don&apos;t enter data for PACEs not showing in the table.

## Troubleshooting

### "I Can&apos;t See Any Students"

**Causes:**
1. You&apos;re not assigned to any learning centres
2. Your assigned centres have no students
3. Students in your centres have no PACE assignments

**Solutions:**
1. Contact your administrator to verify centre assignment
2. Ensure students exist in your centres
3. Verify students have PACEs assigned

### "Goal Entry is Slow"

**Causes:**
1. Slow internet connection
2. Too many browser tabs open
3. Device memory low

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet speed (need 1+ Mbps)
2. Close other tabs and apps
3. Restart device if sluggish

### "Data Not Saving"

**Causes:**
1. No internet connection
2. Invalid data (errors in fields)
3. Session expired (logged out)

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection (look for offline banner)
2. Review fields for red error messages
3. Refresh page and log in again

### "I Forgot My Password"

**Solution:**
1. Go to Zion login page
2. Click "Forgot Password"
3. Enter your email
4. Check email for password reset link
5. Set new password

### "Students Showing in Wrong Order"

**Not an Error:**

## Working with Supervisors

### Your Supervisor&apos;s Role

**What Your Supervisor Does:**
- Uses the data you enter to generate reports
- Analyzes student performance trends
- Plans interventions for struggling students
- Sets strategic goals for the centre

**How Your Work Helps:**
- Your accurate data entry enables all supervisor functions
- Timely entry (daily) keeps data fresh and actionable
- Notes you add help supervisor understand student struggles

### Communication Tips

**Report to Your Supervisor:**
- Students consistently missing goals (3+ days)
- Data entry issues or technical problems
- Questions about appropriate goal difficulty
- Students with special circumstances (illness, etc.)

**Ask Your Supervisor:**
- "What goal pages should I set for new student?"
- "Student struggling - should I lower goals?"
- "I&apos;m unsure how to handle [situation] - advice?"

**Don&apos;t:**
- Make strategic decisions (that&apos;s supervisor role)
- Skip data entry without notifying supervisor
- Guess at goal pages if unsure (ask first)
