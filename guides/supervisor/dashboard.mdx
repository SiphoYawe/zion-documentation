- Y-axis: Completion rate percentage (0-100%)
- Line: Daily completion rate trend

**Reading the Chart:**

**Upward Trend**
- Line slopes upward from left to right
- Completion rates improving over time
- Example: Mon 70%, Tue 75%, Wed 80%, Thu 85%
- Indicator: Students settling into routines, goals appropriately set

## Understanding Dashboard Metrics

### Completion Rate Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Completion Rate = (Students Completed + Students Exceeded) / Total Students Marked × 100
```

**Example:**
- 30 students in your centre
- 25 students marked so far today
- Of those 25: 18 completed, 3 exceeded, 4 missed
- Completion Rate = (18 + 3) / 25 × 100 = 84%

**Why "Students Marked" is the Denominator:**
- You can&apos;t know completion until progress is marked
- Early in day, completion rate shows partial data
- Once all students marked, completion rate is final

**Target Completion Rates:**
- **Excellent:** 85%+ (students consistently meeting goals)
- **Good:** 75-84% (most students succeeding)
- **Fair:** 60-74% (goals may be too ambitious)
- **Poor:** &lt;60% (significant issue - goals too high or students struggling)

### Variance Interpretation

**Positive Variance (+pages):**
- Student completed MORE pages than goal
- Could mean: Goal too low, student extra motivated, easy PACE section
- Action: Consider increasing goals slightly if consistently positive

**Zero Variance (0 pages):**
- Student met goal exactly
- Ideal scenario: Goal was appropriate and achievable
- Action: Continue similar goal-setting

**Negative Variance (-pages):**
- Student completed FEWER pages than goal
- Could mean: Goal too high, student struggled, PACE section difficult, external factors
- Action: Investigate cause, adjust future goals if needed

**Variance Trends:**
- Consistently positive variance (5+ days): Goals likely too low
- Consistently negative variance (3+ days): Goals likely too high or student needs support
- Mixed variance (some +, some -): Goals appropriately challenging

## Multi-Centre Supervision

**If You Supervise Multiple Centres:**

### Centre Comparison View

**Enable Centre Comparison:**
1. Toggle "Compare Centres" switch at top of dashboard
2. View side-by-side KPI cards for each centre
3. Compare completion rates, at-risk counts, trends

**Example with 3 Centres:**
- **Faith Centre:** 85% completion, 2 at-risk students, upward trend
- **Grace Centre:** 72% completion, 5 at-risk students, flat trend
- **Hope Centre:** 90% completion, 1 at-risk student, upward trend

**Insights:**
- Grace Centre needs attention (lower completion, more at-risk students)
- Hope Centre performing excellently
- Faith Centre improving

### Filtering by Centre

**Student Progress Table:**
- Use centre dropdown to filter table to one centre at a time
- Example: Show only "Faith Centre" students
- Helpful for focused analysis

**Trends Chart:**
- Toggle individual centres on/off in chart legend
- Compare centre trends side-by-side
- Identify which centre needs support

### Alerts by Centre

**Alerts grouped by centre:**
- See which centre has most alerts
- Prioritize support where needed most
- Balance your time across centres

## Dashboard Best Practices

### Daily Habits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Morning Glance (30 sec)">
    Check KPIs and alerts before setting goals
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mid-Day Check (30 sec)">
    Quick table scan to identify struggling students
  </Step>

  <Step title="End-of-Day Review (2 min)">
    Verify readiness before marking progress
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Weekly Habits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monday Morning">
    Review last week&apos;s trends, plan week ahead
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mid-Week Check (Wed)">
    Ensure week is on track, address issues early
  </Step>

  <Step title="Friday Afternoon">
    Analyze full week, generate reports, plan interventions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Data-Driven Decision Making

**Use Dashboard Data to:**
1. **Adjust Goals:** If completion &lt;70% for 3+ days, lower goals
2. **Identify Support Needs:** Students with 3+ consecutive misses need intervention
3. **Celebrate Success:** Students with 5+ consecutive completions deserve recognition
4. **Plan Curriculum:** If all students struggle in one subject, review PACE difficulty
5. **Optimize Scheduling:** If certain days always low, consider schedule changes

### Avoid Common Pitfalls

**Don&apos;t:**
- Obsess over 100% completion (85%+ is excellent)
- Compare students to each other (individualized pacing is core to ACE)
- Ignore alerts (they exist for a reason)
- Only check dashboard once a week (daily glances catch issues early)
- Set goals too high to "challenge" students (achievable goals build confidence)

## Troubleshooting Dashboard Issues

### "Dashboard Shows 0 Students"

**Causes:**
1. You&apos;re not assigned to any learning centres
2. Your assigned centres have no students
3. All students in your centres are deactivated

**Solutions:**
1. Contact administrator to assign you to centres
2. Add students to your centres
3. Reactivate students if appropriate

### "Completion Rate Seems Wrong"

**Common Reasons:**
1. Only partial students marked (denominator is "students marked", not "total students")
2. Viewing wrong date (check date filter at top)
3. Goals set but progress not marked (completion is 0% until marking happens)

**Verify:**
- Check "Students Marked" count - if low, completion % is only partial
- Confirm you&apos;re viewing today&apos;s date
- Ensure progress has been marked for students

### "Trends Chart Shows Gaps"

**Causes:**
1. No goals set or progress marked on those days
2. Weekends or holidays (no school)
3. Data not yet loaded

**Normal Behavior:**
- Gaps on Sat/Sun are expected (most schools don&apos;t operate weekends)
- Past dates with no data show 0% or blank

### "Student Not Appearing in Table"

**Causes:**
1. Student not assigned to your centre
2. Student deactivated
3. Active filter hiding student

**Solutions:**
1. Verify student&apos;s learning centre assignment
2. Check if student is active
3. Clear all filters and search again

### "Alerts Not Showing"

**Causes:**
1. No students meet alert criteria (good news!)
2. Not enough historical data (alerts require 3-5 days of data)
3. All students performing well

**Verify:**
- Check if you have students with 3+ consecutive misses
- Ensure you have 5+ days of Goal Check data
- Confirm alerts are enabled (administrator setting)

## Dashboard FAQs

**Q: Why does completion rate change throughout the day?**
A: Completion rate is calculated based on students marked so far. As you mark more students, the rate updates to reflect the full picture.

**Q: Can I see other supervisors&apos; dashboards?**
A: No, you only see your assigned centres. This maintains data privacy and keeps you focused on your responsibilities. Administrators see school-wide data.

**Q: How often does dashboard update?**
A: Real-time. As you mark progress, KPIs and table update immediately. Refresh page if data seems stale.

**Q: Can I customize which KPIs show?**
A: Not currently. KPIs are standardized for consistency across all supervisors. Custom KPIs are planned for future release.

**Q: What&apos;s the difference between "Completed" and "Exceeded"?**
A: Both mean student met their goal. "Completed" means actual = goal (or slightly over). "Exceeded" means actual significantly > goal (variance >+3 pages). Both count as success.

**Q: Should I aim for 100% completion?**
A: 85%+ is excellent. 100% consistently may mean goals are too low. 75-85% is good. &lt;75% may mean goals too high or students need support.
