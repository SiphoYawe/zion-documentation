# Supervisor Goal Check Workflow

This guide walks supervisors through the complete daily Goal Check workflow in Zion, from morning goal setting to end-of-day progress marking and report generation.

  What used to take 2-3 hours of manual compilation now takes less than 10 minutes total - 5 minutes in the morning, 5 minutes at end of day

## Your Role as Supervisor

As a supervisor, you&apos;re responsible for Goal Check in your assigned learning centres. Your daily workflow:

**Morning (5 minutes):**
- Set daily PACE page goals for all students in your centres

**Throughout the Day:**
- Monitor student progress via real-time dashboard
- Provide support to struggling students

**End of Day (5 minutes):**
- Mark actual pages completed for all students
- Add notes for students who struggled

**When Ready:**
- Generate daily centre reports (when all students marked)

## Morning: Setting Daily Goals

### Access Goal Entry

1. Log into Zion
2. Click "Goal Check" in sidebar
3. Click "Set Goals"
4. Confirm date is today (or select different date)

### Goal Entry Interface

You&apos;ll see a table with:
- **Columns:** Your students and their assigned PACEs
- **Rows:** Goal start page, goal end page, goal total pages (auto-calculated)

**For each student/PACE:**
1. Enter **Goal Start Page** (e.g., 15)
2. Enter **Goal End Page** (e.g., 20)
3. System automatically calculates **Goal Total Pages** (6 pages)

<Tip>
**Auto-Save:** Goals save automatically as you type. No "Submit" button needed - just enter data and navigate away when done.
</Tip>

### Quick Templates

Save time with templating features:

**Copy Previous Day:**
1. Click "Copy Previous Day" button
2. Yesterday&apos;s goals pre-fill for all students
3. Adjust as needed for students who completed/didn&apos;t complete goals

**Standard Daily Goals by Grade:**
- Grades 1-4: 5-6 pages per subject
- Grades 5-8: 7-8 pages per subject
- Grades 9-12: 9-10 pages per subject

These are guidelines - adjust based on student ability and PACE difficulty.

### Validation

Zion validates your entries:
- ✅ Goal start page must be ≤ goal end page
- ✅ Goal end page must be ≤ PACE total pages
- ❌ Invalid entries show error messages

### Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Previous Day">
    Copy previous day&apos;s goals as a baseline for continuity
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust for Completion">
    If student completed yesterday&apos;s goal, start where they left off. If not, continue from same pages.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Consider PACE Difficulty">
    Some PACE sections are harder than others. Adjust page counts accordingly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Student Ability Matters">
    Advanced students may handle 10+ pages, while struggling students may need 3-4 pages to succeed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Achievable Goals">
    Better to set lower goals students can achieve than high goals they&apos;ll miss consistently.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Throughout the Day: Monitoring Progress

### Supervisor Dashboard

Your dashboard shows real-time status for your centres only.

**Access:**
1. Click "Dashboard" in sidebar
2. You&apos;ll see your supervisor dashboard

**Dashboard Sections:**

**My Students Today (KPI Cards):**
- Total students in my centres
- Students completed vs missed vs not started
- My centres&apos; overall completion rate

**Student Progress Table:**
Real-time table with all your students showing:
- Student name
- Current PACEs
- Today&apos;s goals (goal pages)
- Actual pages completed (updates as you mark)
- Variance (+/- from goal)
- Status badge (Completed/Exceeded/Missed/Not Started)

**Color-Coded Badges:**
- 🟢 **Green (Completed):** Actual pages ≥ goal pages
- 🔵 **Blue (Exceeded):** Actual pages > goal pages
- 🔴 **Red (Missed):** Actual pages < goal pages
- ⚪ **Gray (Not Started):** Not yet marked

**My Centre Trends:**
- Line chart showing last 7 days completion rates
- See if your centres are improving or declining

**My Alerts:**
- Students missing goals today
- Students with declining trend (last 3-5 days)

### Using the Dashboard

**Quick Check (30 seconds):**
1. Glance at completion % for the day
2. Note how many students still need marking

**Mid-Day Check (2 minutes):**
1. Review Student Progress Table
2. Identify students who may be struggling today
3. Provide in-person support as needed

**Before Marking (2 minutes):**
1. Verify all students have completed their work
2. Prepare to enter actual pages completed

---

## End of Day: Marking Progress

### Access Progress Marking

1. Click "Goal Check" in sidebar
2. Click "Mark Progress"
3. Confirm date is today (or select different date)

### Progress Marking Interface

Similar to goal entry, but now you enter **actual** pages completed:

**For each student/PACE:**
1. View goal pages (set this morning)
2. Enter **Actual Start Page** (what they started on)
3. Enter **Actual End Page** (what they finished on)
4. System calculates **Actual Total Pages**
5. System shows **Variance** (actual vs goal)

### Understanding Variance

**Variance = Actual Total Pages - Goal Total Pages**

Examples:
- **+2 pages:** Student did 2 more pages than goal (exceeded!)
- **0 pages:** Student met goal exactly (completed)
- **-3 pages:** Student did 3 fewer pages than goal (missed)

### Adding Notes

For students who struggled or exceeded:

1. Click "Add Notes" for that student/PACE
2. Enter brief feedback (e.g., "Struggled with division concepts" or "Completed early, very focused")
3. Notes help track patterns and plan interventions

<Tip>
**When to Add Notes:** Always add notes for students who miss goals 2+ days in a row. This helps identify students needing intervention.
</Tip>

### Auto-Save & Visual Feedback

- Entries auto-save as you type (500ms debounce)
- Checkmarks appear when saved
- Color-coded badges update in real-time

### Completion Status

When you enter actual pages, status automatically updates:
- **"Not Started"** → **"Completed"**
- System calculates variance
- Dashboard updates in real-time

## Generating Daily Centre Reports

### When to Generate

Reports can only be generated when **all students in your centre are marked** for the day.

**Readiness Indicator:**
- "Ready (10/10 students marked)" - generate now!
- "Pending (7/10 students marked)" - 3 more students need marking

### How to Generate

1. Navigate to "Reports"
2. Select your centre
3. Select date (today or past date)
4. Check readiness indicator
5. When ready, click "Generate Daily Report"
6. Wait ~30 seconds for generation
7. Download PDF or CSV

### Report Contents

**Centre Summary:**
- Centre name, date, total students
- Goal achievement breakdown:
  - Students completed (met goal)
  - Students exceeded goal
  - Students missed goal
  - Students not started
- Overall completion rate %

**Student-by-Student Breakdown:**
- Student name, PACE, goal pages, actual pages, variance
- Notes (if added)
- At-risk flags for students missing goals

**Use Cases:**
- Share with administrator for review
- Document daily centre performance
- Identify students needing intervention
- Weekly review to track patterns

---

## Weekly Centre Review

### Best Practice Weekly Routine

**Friday Afternoon (15 minutes):**

1. Generate Monday-Friday daily reports
2. Review week&apos;s performance:
   - Which students consistently met/exceeded goals?
   - Which students missed goals 3+ days?
   - Which days had lower completion rates?
   - Which PACEs/subjects struggled most?
3. Plan next week:
   - Adjust goal page counts for struggling students
   - Provide extra support in difficult subjects
   - Celebrate students with excellent performance

<Tip>
**Pattern Recognition:** Look for patterns. If completion drops every Friday, students may be fatigued - consider lower goals Fridays or more engaging activities.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### "I can&apos;t see some students"
**Solution:** You only see students in your assigned centres. Contact administrator if centres are incorrect.

### "Goal entry is slow on tablet"
**Solution:** Use virtual scrolling for 50+ students. Close other apps to free memory.

### "I forgot to set goals this morning"
**Solution:** You can set goals anytime. Students can still work from their PACEs while you enter goals.

### "Student completed different pages than goal"
**Solution:** That&apos;s okay! Enter the actual pages they completed. Variance will reflect the difference.

### "Can I change goals after setting them?"
**Solution:** Yes! Goals are editable until you mark progress. Just go back to Set Goals and update.

### "Report won&apos;t generate"
**Solution:** Check that ALL students in your centre are marked. One unmarked student blocks report generation.
