## Best Practices

### Initial School Setup

**Recommended Order:**
1. Create all learning centres first
2. Invite all supervisors and monitors together
3. Assign each supervisor to their primary centre(s)
4. Assign monitors to support specific centres
5. Test: Have one supervisor log in and verify access

**Timeline:**
- 1 week before term starts: Invite all staff
- 3 days before term starts: Follow up with staff who haven&apos;t accepted
- 1 day before term starts: Verify all staff can log in

### Mid-Year Staff Changes

**New Staff Joining:**
1. Create invitation immediately
2. Assign to appropriate centres
3. Have them shadow existing supervisor for 1-2 days
4. Grant access to Goal Check once trained

**Staff Departing:**
1. Reassign centres to other staff BEFORE deactivation
2. Generate final reports for their centres
3. Deactivate user account
4. Document transition in staff notes

### Annual Maintenance

**Start of Academic Year:**
- Review all staff assignments
- Update centre assignments for any changes
- Reactivate returning staff if they were deactivated
- Invite new staff for the year

**End of Academic Year:**
- Generate final reports for all centres
- Optionally deactivate staff on summer break (or keep active)
- Document any staff departures

## Security Best Practices

### Email Address Management

**DO:**
- Use school email addresses when possible
- Verify email address before sending invitation
- Keep staff email addresses current

**DON&apos;T:**
- Share login credentials between staff
- Use personal email if school policy prohibits
- Reuse email addresses from deactivated staff

### Password Requirements

Zion (via Clerk) enforces:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

**Best Practice:** Encourage staff to use password managers

### Access Principle

**Least Privilege:**
- Give staff minimum access needed for their role
- Use Monitor role for assistants (not Supervisor)
- Assign only necessary centres

**Regular Audits:**
- Quarterly: Review staff list, deactivate unused accounts
- Annually: Verify all assignments still appropriate

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Invitation Email Not Received"
**Possible Causes:** Email in spam, typo in email address, email server blocking
**Solutions:**
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify email address is correct
3. Resend invitation
4. Try alternative email address

### "Staff Can&apos;t See Learning Centre"
**Cause:** Staff not assigned to that centre
**Solution:** Edit staff member, assign them to the centre, save, have them log out and back in

### "Staff Can&apos;t Generate Reports"
**Cause:** Staff has Monitor role (monitors can&apos;t generate reports)
**Solution:** Change role from Monitor to Supervisor

### "Staff Sees All Centres (Should Only See Assigned)"
**Cause:** Staff might be an Administrator
**Solution:** Verify role is Supervisor or Monitor, not Administrator

### "Can&apos;t Change Staff Email Address"
**Cause:** Email is managed by Clerk authentication system
**Solution:** Contact Zion support to change email address, or deactivate old account and create new invitation
