# Administrator Goal Check Oversight

As an administrator, you oversee Goal Check across your entire school - not entering daily data, but monitoring performance, identifying trends, and planning interventions. This guide shows you how to use Zion&apos;s Goal Check intelligence features for school-wide oversight.

<Note>
**Delegation Note:** Administrators typically do NOT enter daily goals or mark progress. That&apos;s handled by supervisors and monitors. Your role is oversight and strategic intervention.
</Note>

## Your Goal Check Responsibilities

As administrator, your Goal Check workflow focuses on:

**Daily (2 minutes):**
- Review school-wide completion metrics on dashboard
- Check at-risk student alerts
- Verify all centres have active goal entry/marking

**Weekly (15 minutes):**
- Generate and analyze weekly school reports
- Compare centre performance
- Plan interventions for struggling students/centres
- Share insights with leadership team

**Monthly (30 minutes):**
- Analyze cumulative trends across multiple weeks
- Evaluate subject performance patterns
- Assess supervisor/centre effectiveness
- Prepare reports for board/leadership

## At-Risk Student Intervention Strategies

### Tier 1: Lower Goals

**When to Use:**
- Student consistently missing by 2-3 pages
- Pattern: Effort is there, goals just too high

**How to Implement:**
1. Identify average pages student completes daily (e.g., 4 pages)
2. Set new goals slightly above average (e.g., 5 pages)
3. Monitor for 1 week
4. Gradually increase as student succeeds

**Expected Outcome:** Immediate improvement, builds confidence

### Tier 2: One-on-One Support

**When to Use:**
- Student struggling with specific subject/concept
- Pattern: Completes some PACEs fine, struggles with one

**How to Implement:**
1. Assign supervisor or peer tutor for 30 min/day
2. Focus on the struggling subject
3. Re-teach concepts as needed
4. Continue until student catches up

**Expected Outcome:** 2-3 weeks to see improvement

### Tier 3: PACE Reassignment

**When to Use:**
- PACE is too difficult for student&apos;s current level
- Pattern: Student completely lost, not making any progress

**How to Implement:**
1. Assess student&apos;s true level with diagnostic test
2. Reassign to appropriate PACE level (may be 1-2 levels lower)
3. Set achievable goals at new level
4. Build up gradually

**Expected Outcome:** Immediate relief, 1-2 months to catch back up

### Tier 4: Schedule/Workload Adjustment

**When to Use:**
- Student overloaded (too many PACEs)
- Pattern: Missing goals across ALL subjects consistently

**How to Implement:**
1. Reduce total PACEs from 6 to 4
2. Focus on core subjects (Math, English, Science)
3. Lower daily page goals across the board
4. Gradually increase workload as student stabilizes

**Expected Outcome:** 1-2 weeks to stabilize

### Tier 5: External Support

**When to Use:**
- Interventions 1-4 not working
- Pattern: Persistent struggle despite adjustments

**How to Implement:**
1. Meeting with parents to discuss challenges
2. Assess for learning disabilities or external factors
3. Consider professional educational assessment
4. Develop individualized education plan if needed

**Expected Outcome:** 4-8 weeks to see results

<Warning>
**Document Everything:** Keep notes of all interventions in student&apos;s Goal Check notes. This creates audit trail and helps if escalation is needed.
</Warning>

## Centre Performance Analysis

### Comparing Centre Performance

**Why Centres Differ:**

**Supervisor Effectiveness (30-40% of variance):**
- Experienced supervisors set better goals
- Strong classroom management = better completion
- Engaged supervisors = more student support

**Student Composition (30-40% of variance):**
- Centre with advanced students performs better
- Centre with many struggling students performs worse
- Age/grade mix affects dynamics

**PACE Difficulty (20-30% of variance):**
- Some PACE subjects inherently harder (e.g., advanced Math)
- Centres with harder PACEs may have lower completion

**Centre Size (10% of variance):**
- Smaller centres (10-15 students) often perform better
- Larger centres (25+) harder to manage

### Identifying Top-Performing Centres

**Characteristics:**
- Consistent 85%+ completion
- Low at-risk count
- Positive week-over-week trends
- Low variance between students (all succeeding)

**What to Learn:**
1. Interview supervisor: What strategies work?
2. Observe classroom: What&apos;s different?
3. Document best practices
4. Share with other supervisors

**Share Success:**
- Feature centre in staff meetings
- Document supervisor&apos;s approach
- Use as mentors for struggling supervisors

### Supporting Struggling Centres

**Characteristics:**
- Consistent &lt;60% completion
- High at-risk count
- Declining trends
- High variance (some students thriving, many struggling)

**Intervention Steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Diagnose Root Cause">
    Meet with supervisor to understand challenges. Review student composition and PACE difficulty.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Observe Classroom">
    Spend 1-2 hours observing goal entry and student work. Note inefficiencies or issues.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Action Plan">
    Based on diagnosis: Lower goals school-wide in that centre, reassign students to balance ability levels, provide supervisor training/mentoring, adjust PACE assignments.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pair with Top Centre">
    Have struggling supervisor shadow top-performing supervisor for 1 week.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Check centre&apos;s dashboard daily for 2 weeks. Look for improvement. If no improvement, consider supervisor reassignment or centre restructure.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data-Driven Decision Making

### Using Variance Data

**Positive Variance Patterns:**
- Consistent +2 to +4 across all students in a centre
- **Indicates:** Goals too easy, students not challenged
- **Action:** Gradually increase goals by 1-2 pages

**Negative Variance Patterns:**
- Consistent -2 to -4 across all students in a centre
- **Indicates:** Goals too high, students discouraged
- **Action:** Immediately lower goals by 2-3 pages

**Mixed Variance (Wide Spread):**
- Some students +5, others -5 in same centre
- **Indicates:** Goals not individualized enough
- **Action:** Set different goals per student based on ability

### Subject Performance Analysis

**Example Scenario:**
- Math: 65% completion
- English: 85% completion
- Science: 80% completion
- Social Studies: 82% completion

**Analysis:**
- Math significantly lower than other subjects
- Pattern consistent across multiple centres
- Indicates: Math PACEs too difficult OR Math instruction needs improvement

**Actions:**
1. Review Math PACE levels for all students (are they appropriate?)
2. Provide Math-specific training for supervisors
3. Consider peer tutoring for Math
4. Lower Math-specific goals until students stabilize

### Trend Analysis for Strategic Planning

**Month-Over-Month Trends:**
- Plot completion rates for 3-4 months
- Identify long-term patterns
- Example: If completion declines every term, indicates need for mid-term break or workload reduction

**Year-Over-Year Comparison:**
- Compare Term 1 2025 to Term 1 2024
- Shows if school improving overall
- Useful for board reporting and strategic planning

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Dashboard Shows 0% Completion"
**Possible Causes:**
- No goals set today yet (morning)
- No progress marked yet (throughout day)
- All centres inactive
- Wrong active term selected

**Solution:** Verify goals are being set, check that active term is correct, ensure centres are active

### "Weekly Report Shows No Data"
**Possible Causes:**
- Selected week has no Goal Check data
- Week range includes future dates
- Active term doesn&apos;t cover selected week

**Solution:** Verify date range is within active term, ensure Goal Check data exists for that week

### "Completion Rate Suddenly Dropped"
**Possible Causes:**
- Goals increased too much
- Supervisor absent (substitute not setting goals properly)
- External event (field trip, illness outbreak)
- Data entry error

**Solution:** Investigate cause, review goals vs previous week, talk to supervisors, verify data accuracy

### "At-Risk Count Keeps Growing"
**Possible Causes:**
- Interventions not effective
- Goals systematically too high
- Curriculum too difficult
- Lack of follow-through on interventions

**Solution:** Review intervention strategies, consider school-wide goal reduction, assess PACE levels, ensure interventions are actually implemented
