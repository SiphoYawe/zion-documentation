## Learning Centre Assignment

### Initial Assignment

When adding students, assign to a learning centre based on:
- **Grade Level:** Group similar grades together
- **Centre Capacity:** Don&apos;t exceed capacity limits
- **Supervisor Load:** Balance student count across supervisors
- **Student Needs:** Consider special needs, abilities, learning styles

### Reassigning Students to Different Centres

**Common Scenarios:**
- Centre rebalancing (one centre too full)
- Student needs change (requires different supervisor)
- Grade progression (moving to older student centre)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit Student">
    Navigate to Students, click "Edit" on student
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Centre">
    Select new learning centre from dropdown
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save Student"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Access">
    Ensure new centre&apos;s supervisor can now see student in their dashboard
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Effect of Reassignment:**
- Student immediately appears in new centre&apos;s lists
- Student disappears from old centre&apos;s lists
- Historical Goal Check data preserved (shows which centre student was in at that time)
- Supervisor sees student on next dashboard refresh

<Warning>
**Mid-Term Reassignments:** Reassigning students mid-term disrupts their routine and supervisor relationships. Best to do during term breaks unless urgent.
</Warning>

## PACE Assignments

### Why PACE Assignments Matter

**Required for Goal Check:**
- Students MUST have assigned PACEs before Goal Check can begin
- Goal entry shows PACEs as columns
- Without PACEs, student cannot have goals set

**Individualized Learning:**
- Each student has their own PACE assignments
- Different students can work on different PACEs in same subject
- Allows personalized pacing

### Assigning PACEs to Students

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Student Profile">
    Click on student name from Students list
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Assign PACE">
    In student detail page, click "Assign PACE" or "Manage PACEs"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search for PACE">
    Use PACE catalog search (by number or subject)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select PACE">
    Click on PACE to assign it to student
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat">
    Assign 4-6 PACEs (one per subject typically)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save PACE Assignments"
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Typical PACE Load Per Student:**
- **Light Load:** 3-4 PACEs (struggling students, primary grades)
- **Standard Load:** 5-6 PACEs (most students)
- **Heavy Load:** 7-8 PACEs (advanced students, high school)

See [PACE Assignments Guide](/features/students/pace-assignments) for detailed instructions.

### PACE Catalog Structure

**PACE Numbering:** 1001-1144 (144 total PACEs in catalog)

**Subjects:**
- **1001-1012:** English
- **1013-1024:** Math
- **1025-1036:** Science
- **1037-1048:** Social Studies
- **1049-1060:** Word Building
- And more...

Each PACE has ~36 pages typically.

See [PACE Catalog Reference](/features/paces/catalog) for complete list.

- Historical data preserved
- Can be reactivated later

### Deactivating Students

**When to Deactivate:**

  </Step>
</Steps>

**What Happens:**
- Student immediately removed from active lists
- Supervisors no longer see student in Goal Check entry
- Historical data preserved (all past Goal Check entries remain)
- Can generate historical reports including this student

### Reactivating Students

**When to Reactivate:**
- Student returns after leave
- Student re-enrolls
- Accidental deactivation

<Steps>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify PACE Assignments">
    Ensure PACE assignments are still appropriate
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Initial School Setup

**Week 1-2 Before Term Starts:**
1. Gather complete student roster (names, DOBs, grades)
2. Decide centre assignments (balance by grade/ability)
3. Create CSV file with all students
4. Import CSV into Zion
5. Verify import success (student count matches)

**Week 1 of Term:**
1. Assign PACEs to all students (4-6 per student)
2. Verify each student has PACEs assigned
3. Test: Have supervisor set goals for a few students

### Mid-Year Enrollments

**New Student Joins:**
1. Add student immediately (individual entry)
2. Assign to appropriate centre based on grade/capacity
3. Assign PACEs matching their current level
4. Inform supervisor that new student added
5. Supervisor sets goals starting next day

**Student Withdraws:**
1. Generate final reports for that student
2. Deactivate student profile
3. Document withdrawal date in notes
4. Inform supervisor

### Annual Maintenance

**Start of Academic Year:**
1. Promote students to next grade (mass update if needed)
2. Rebalance centre assignments (new grade groupings)
3. Update PACE assignments for new academic year
4. Reactivate any students returning from leave

**End of Academic Year:**
1. Generate final reports for all students
2. Optionally deactivate graduating seniors
3. Document academic year completion
4. Archive student data if needed (export to CSV)

### Data Quality

**Regular Audits (Monthly):**
- Verify all active students have assigned PACEs
- Check for duplicate student entries
- Update grade levels if mid-year promotions occur
- Correct any misspelled names

**Red Flags:**
- Student with 0 PACEs assigned (cannot do Goal Check)
- Student in wrong grade for their age
- Duplicate student entries (same name and DOB)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Student Not Appearing in Goal Check"
**Causes:**
1. Student has no PACE assignments
2. Student is deactivated
3. Supervisor not assigned to student&apos;s centre

**Solutions:**
1. Assign PACEs to student
2. Reactivate student if appropriate
3. Assign supervisor to student&apos;s learning centre

### "CSV Import Failed"
**Common Errors:**
- Learning centre name doesn&apos;t match exactly (check spelling, case)
- Date format wrong (use YYYY-MM-DD)
- Grade level not 1-12
- Missing required fields (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, grade_level, learning_centre_name)

**Solution:** Download error report, fix CSV, re-upload

### "Cannot Deactivate Student"
**Cause:** Student may have active Goal Check entries for today
**Solution:** Wait until next day or have supervisor remove today&apos;s entries

### "Student in Wrong Centre"
**Cause:** Assigned to incorrect centre during import or entry
**Solution:** Edit student, change learning centre, save
