## School Profile Fields

### Basic Information

## Branding: School Logo

### Logo Requirements

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Formats:** PNG or JPG
- **Max File Size:** 2MB
- **Recommended Dimensions:** 500×500px (square) or 1000×500px (horizontal)
- **Background:** Transparent PNG recommended for best results

**Visual Guidelines:**
- Simple, recognizable design works best
- High contrast for visibility on both light and dark backgrounds
- Avoid very detailed logos (they may not scale well)

### Uploading Your Logo

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Logo File">
    Save logo as PNG (preferred) or JPG, ensure it meets size requirements
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Upload Button">
    In School Profile form, click "Upload Logo" button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select File">
    Choose your logo file from computer
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview">
    Logo preview appears immediately - verify it looks correct
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save School Profile" to apply logo throughout platform
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Processing Time:** Instant (appears immediately after save)

### Where Your Logo Appears

**In Zion Platform:**
- Navigation sidebar (top left)
- Login page
- All dashboard pages

**In Generated Reports:**
- PDF daily centre reports (header)
- PDF weekly school reports (header)
- Printed materials

<Warning>
**Logo Changes Are Immediate:** When you update your logo, it appears immediately on all pages and in future reports. Past reports retain the logo that was active when they were generated.
</Warning>

### Logo Best Practices

**Square Logo (500×500px):**
- Best for: Schools with circular or square emblems
- Scales well in navigation sidebar
- Works on all report formats

**Horizontal Logo (1000×500px or 2:1 ratio):**
- Best for: Schools with long school names in logo
- May be cropped in some sidebar views
- Excellent for report headers

**Transparent Background:**
- Use PNG with transparent background
- Adapts to both light and dark theme in platform
- Looks professional on all backgrounds

**High Resolution:**
- Use at least 500px minimum dimension
- Prevents pixelation when printed
- Ensures crisp display on high-resolution screens

## Timezone Configuration

### Why Timezone Matters

**Critical for:**
- Goal Check date accuracy (ensures "today" matches your actual today)
- Report timestamps (all reports show your local time)
- Scheduled operations (if any automated tasks run)
- Audit trail timestamps (track who did what when in your local time)

**What Happens with Wrong Timezone:**
- Goals set "tomorrow" when you think it&apos;s "today"
- Reports show wrong dates
- Dashboard metrics misaligned with your actual day

### Selecting Your Timezone

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Timezone Dropdown">
    In School Profile form, scroll to "Timezone" field
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search or Scroll">
    Type your city name or scroll through alphabetical list
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Exact Match">
    Choose timezone that matches your location exactly (e.g., "Africa/Kampala", "America/Chicago")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save School Profile"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Timezones for ACE Schools

**Africa:**
- East Africa: Africa/Nairobi (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania)
- West Africa: Africa/Lagos (Nigeria)
- South Africa: Africa/Johannesburg

**Americas:**
- US Eastern: America/New_York
- US Central: America/Chicago
- US Mountain: America/Denver
- US Pacific: America/Los_Angeles

**Asia:**
- Philippines: Asia/Manila
- Singapore: Asia/Singapore

**Oceania:**
- Australia Eastern: Australia/Sydney
- New Zealand: Pacific/Auckland

<Warning>
**Timezone Changes and Historical Data:** Changing timezone DOES NOT retroactively adjust existing Goal Check dates. Only future data uses the new timezone. Be very careful when changing timezone mid-term.
</Warning>

### Timezone Best Practices

1. **Set Once, Forget:** Configure timezone during initial setup and don&apos;t change it
2. **Match Your Location:** Use the timezone for your school&apos;s physical location
3. **Consider Daylight Saving:** Most modern timezones handle DST automatically (e.g., America/New_York switches between EST and EDT)
4. **Verify After Saving:** Set a test goal and verify the date matches your expectation

## Academic Terms Setup

### Understanding Academic Terms

**What Are Terms:**
- Time periods for organizing Goal Check data (e.g., "Term 1 2025", "Fall Semester 2025")
- Most ACE schools have 3 terms per year
- Each term has start date and end date

**Why Terms Matter:**
- All Goal Check data is scoped to the active term
- Reports are generated for specific terms
- Allows year-over-year comparison (Term 1 2025 vs Term 1 2024)
- Prevents data mixing across academic years

**Active Term:**
- Only ONE term can be active at a time
- Active term receives all new Goal Check data
- Dashboard and reports default to active term
- Changing active term DOES NOT delete old term data

### Creating Academic Terms

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Academic Terms">
    Click "Administration" → "Academic Terms" in sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add Term">
    Click "Add Term" button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill Term Details">
    Enter term name, start date, end date
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set as Active (Optional)">
    Check "Set as active term" if this is your current term
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save" to create term
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Estimated Time:** 1 minute per term

### Term Details Explained

#### Term Name
- **Format:** Free text (e.g., "Term 1 2025", "Fall Semester 2025", "Q1 2025")
- **Best Practice:** Include year for clarity
- **Recommendation:** Follow ACE convention if applicable ("Term 1", "Term 2", "Term 3")
- **Character Limit:** 50 characters

#### Start Date
- **Format:** Calendar date picker
- **Meaning:** First day of term when Goal Check data begins
- **Best Practice:** Use actual first day of classes (not planning/prep days)
- **Example:** January 8, 2025

#### End Date
- **Format:** Calendar date picker
- **Meaning:** Last day of term when Goal Check data ends
- **Best Practice:** Use actual last day of classes (not after-term cleanup days)
- **Example:** April 12, 2025
- **Validation:** Must be after start date

### Example Term Schedule

**Three-Term Academic Year:**

**Term 1:**
- Name: "Term 1 2025"
- Start: January 8, 2025
- End: April 12, 2025
- Duration: ~14 weeks

**Term 2:**
- Name: "Term 2 2025"
- Start: April 22, 2025
- End: August 2, 2025
- Duration: ~14 weeks

**Term 3:**
- Name: "Term 3 2025"
- Start: August 19, 2025
- End: December 6, 2025
- Duration: ~14 weeks

<Tip>
**Plan Ahead:** Create all 3 terms at the beginning of the year. You can create inactive terms in advance - just don&apos;t set them as active until they start.
</Tip>

### Managing Active Term

#### Viewing Active Term
- Active term badge shows "Active" in green
- Dashboard always displays active term data
- All new Goal Check entries go to active term

#### Changing Active Term

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Academic Terms">
    Click "Administration" → "Academic Terms"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Target Term">
    Locate the term you want to activate
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Set Active">
    Click "Set Active" button for that term
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Change">
    Confirm you want to change active term
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What Happens:**
- Previous active term becomes inactive (data preserved)
- New active term becomes active
- Dashboard switches to new term data
- All new Goal Check entries go to new term

**When to Change:**
- First day of new term
- AFTER final reports generated for previous term

<Warning>
**End-of-Term Checklist:** Before switching active term, ensure all Goal Check data is marked for previous term and all final reports are generated. You can still access old term data, but it&apos;s easier to finalize before switching.
</Warning>

### Viewing Historical Term Data

Even after a term is inactive, you can still:
- View all Goal Check data from that term
- Generate reports for that term
- Export data from that term
- Reference for year-over-year comparisons

**How to Access:**
1. Navigate to reports or data export
2. Use term filter to select inactive term
3. View/generate reports as normal

## School Profile Best Practices

### Initial Setup Checklist

During your first Zion setup:
- [ ] Verify school name is official name
- [ ] Set location (City, Country format)
- [ ] Add monitored contact email
- [ ] Add main school phone with country code
- [ ] Upload high-quality logo (PNG with transparent background)
- [ ] Set timezone for your location
- [ ] Create all 3 terms for current academic year
- [ ] Set current term as active
- [ ] Test: Set a goal and verify date is correct

### Annual Maintenance Routine

**Start of Each Academic Year:**
1. Review school profile information (update if changed)
2. Create next year&apos;s 3 terms
3. On first day of Term 1, set it as active term
4. Generate final reports for previous year before switching

**Mid-Year Checks:**
- Verify contact email is still monitored
- Ensure logo is still current (some schools update branding)
- Confirm phone number hasn&apos;t changed

### Logo Refresh Timing

**When to Update Logo:**
- School rebranding
- Logo design refresh
- Better quality version available
- Current logo looks pixelated

**When NOT to Update:**
- Mid-term (wait until term break)
- During ACE review/accreditation (keep consistency)
- When old reports need to match current branding

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Logo Looks Pixelated"
**Cause:** Logo file resolution too low
**Solution:** Upload higher resolution logo (minimum 500×500px)

### "Dates Are Off by One Day"
**Cause:** Wrong timezone selected
**Solution:** Verify timezone matches your location exactly. Remember: changing timezone doesn&apos;t fix historical data.

### "Can&apos;t Change Active Term"
**Cause:** System validation preventing change
**Solution:** Ensure new term start date has passed. Can&apos;t activate future term.

### "Logo Not Appearing in Reports"
**Cause:** Logo upload didn&apos;t save properly
**Solution:** Re-upload logo, ensure file size &lt;2MB, verify save was successful

### "Contact Email Not Receiving Notifications"
**Cause:** Email in spam folder or invalid
**Solution:** Check spam folder, verify email address is correct and receiving other mail
