# Reports & Analytics Guide

Master Zion&apos;s reporting capabilities - from daily centre reports to comprehensive weekly school analytics. This guide covers report generation, interpretation, and strategic use for school improvement.

## Reporting Overview

**Two Main Report Types:**

**Daily Centre Reports:**
- Scope: Single learning centre, single day
- Purpose: Document daily Goal Check performance for one centre
- Generated by: Supervisors or Administrators
- Frequency: End of each school day when all students marked

**Weekly School Reports:**
- Scope: Entire school, full week (Monday-Friday)
- Purpose: Comprehensive performance analysis across all centres
- Generated by: Administrators only
- Frequency: End of each week or as needed

---

## Daily Centre Reports

### When to Generate Daily Reports

**Readiness Criteria:**
- ALL students in the centre must be marked for that day
- Readiness indicator shows: "Ready (25/25 students marked)"
- Typically generated at end of school day (3-4 PM)

**Best Practice Timing:**
- End of each school day: Generate for that day
- Next morning: Review yesterday&apos;s report for patterns
- Weekly: Review all 5 daily reports together for trends

### Generating Daily Centre Reports

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Reports">
    Click "Reports" → "Daily Centre Reports" in sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Centre">
    Choose learning centre from dropdown (supervisors see only their centres)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Date">
    Choose date for report (defaults to today)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Readiness">
    Verify readiness indicator shows "Ready (X/X students marked)"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Report">
    Click "Generate Daily Report" - takes ~10-30 seconds
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review On-Screen">
    Report displays on screen for review
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download">
    Export as PDF (for sharing/printing) or CSV (for analysis)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 minutes from clicking to downloaded report

### Daily Report Contents

**Report Header:**
- School logo and name
- Centre name
- Report date
- Generation timestamp
- Generated by (supervisor name)

**Centre Summary Card:**
- Total students in centre
- Goals Set: X students had goals set
- Goals Marked: X students marked complete
- Overall Completion Rate: XX%

**Completion Breakdown:**
- Students Completed: Count and % (met or exceeded goal)
- Students Exceeded: Count and % (did more than goal)
- Students Missed: Count and % (did less than goal)
- Students Not Started: Count and % (not yet marked)

**Student-by-Student Detail Table:**

| Student | PACE | Goal Pages | Actual Pages | Variance | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|------------|--------------|----------|--------|-------|
| John Smith | Math 1015 | 6 | 6 | 0 | Completed | - |
| Mary Jones | Math 1013 | 5 | 3 | -2 | Missed | Struggled with division |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**At-Risk Students Section:**
- Lists students who missed goals
- Shows consecutive miss count if applicable
- Highlights students needing intervention

**Footer:**
- Report generation date/time
- School contact information
- Page numbers

### Interpreting Daily Centre Reports

**Healthy Centre Indicators:**
-  Completion rate 80-90%
-  Most students in "Completed" status
-  Low variance spread (most students within ±2 pages)
-  Few or no at-risk students

**Concerning Patterns:**
- ⚠️ Completion rate 50-70%
- ⚠️ Many students missed goals
- ⚠️ Wide variance (some +5, others -5)
- ⚠️ Growing at-risk list

**Critical Issues:**
- 🚨 Completion rate &lt;50%
- 🚨 Majority missed goals
- 🚨 Consistent negative variance
- 🚨 Multiple students with 3+ consecutive misses

### Using Daily Centre Reports

**Daily Review (Supervisor):**
1. Generate report at end of day
2. Scan completion rate (goal: >80%)
3. Note students who missed goals
4. Review notes column for patterns
5. Plan tomorrow&apos;s goals based on today&apos;s actual completion

**Weekly Review (Supervisor + Administrator):**
1. Compile all 5 daily reports (Mon-Fri)
2. Compare completion rates across week
3. Identify students struggling consistently
4. Note which days of week are hardest
5. Plan interventions for struggling students

**Monthly Archive:**
- Save all daily reports as PDFs
- Create folder structure: Year/Month/Centre
- Useful for ACE reviews, parent conferences, historical reference

## Best Practices

### Report Generation Timing

**DO:**
- Generate daily reports every day (creates consistency)
- Generate weekly reports every Friday (routine)
- Export reports immediately after generation (data is fresh)
- Save reports to organized folder structure

**DON&apos;T:**
- Let daily reports pile up (generate weekly without daily data)
- Generate reports mid-day (data incomplete)
- Delete old reports (keep for historical reference)

### Report Sharing

**Daily Centre Reports:**
- Share with: Centre supervisor, administrator
- Frequency: Daily
- Method: Email PDF, shared drive folder

**Weekly School Reports:**
- Share with: All supervisors, leadership team, board
- Frequency: Weekly
- Method: Email PDF with summary insights, present in meetings

**Confidentiality:**
- Student-level data: Administrators and assigned supervisors only
- Aggregated data: Can share with broader stakeholders
- Follow data privacy laws and school policies

### Report Archiving

**Folder Structure:**
```
Reports/
├── 2025/
│   ├── Term1/
│   │   ├── Weekly/
│   │   │   ├── Week01_Jan08-12.pdf
│   │   │   ├── Week02_Jan15-19.pdf
│   │   ├── Daily/

│   │   │   │   ├── 2025-01-09.pdf
│   │   │   ├── Hope/
```

**Retention:**
- Daily reports: 1 year minimum (ACE may require longer)
- Weekly reports: 3-5 years
- Annual summaries: Permanent

## Troubleshooting

### "Report Won&apos;t Generate"

**Daily Centre Report:**
- Check: All students marked? Readiness indicator shows "Ready"?
- Solution: Mark all students, refresh page, try again

**Weekly School Report:**
- Check: Week range within active term? At least 3 days of data?
- Solution: Adjust date range, verify active term, ensure data exists

### "Report Data Looks Wrong"

**Possible Causes:**
- Wrong term selected
- Wrong date range
- Data entry errors (goals/actuals entered incorrectly)

**Solutions:**
- Verify term and dates
- Check source data (Goal Check entries)
- Regenerate report after corrections

### "Report Generation Takes Forever"

**Causes:**
- Large school (300+ students)
- Slow internet connection
- Server load

**Solutions:**
- Be patient (can take up to 2 minutes for very large schools)
- Try during off-peak hours
- Close other browser tabs
