## School Profile Configuration

### Access School Settings

1. Click "Administration" → "Settings" in the sidebar
2. You&apos;ll see the School Profile form

### Required Information

**School Details:**
- **School Name:** Auto-filled from your organization name (editable)
- **Location:** City and country (e.g., "Kampala, Uganda")
- **Contact Email:** Main school email address
- **Phone Number:** School phone number with country code

**Technical Settings:**
- **Timezone:** Select your timezone (e.g., "Africa/Kampala", "America/New_York")
  - This ensures Goal Check dates and reports use your local time
- **Logo:** Upload PNG/JPG, max 2MB
  - Appears in navigation and on all generated reports

### Best Practices

<Tip>
**Logo Guidelines:** Use a square or horizontal logo with transparent background (PNG) for best results. Recommended size: 500x500px or 1000x500px.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Timezone Important:** Choose your timezone carefully. Changing it later will not retroactively adjust existing Goal Check dates.
</Warning>

## Academic Terms Setup

### Why Academic Terms Matter

Academic terms define the time periods for Goal Check data tracking. All goals, reports, and analytics are scoped to terms.

### Creating Terms

1. Navigate to "Academic Terms" in sidebar
2. Click "Add Term"
3. Fill in:
   - **Term Name:** E.g., "Term 1 2025", "Fall Semester 2025"
   - **Start Date:** First day of term
   - **End Date:** Last day of term
4. Check **"Set as active term"** for your current term
5. Click "Save"

### Multiple Terms Per Year

Most ACE schools have 3 terms per year. You can create all terms upfront or add them as needed:

**Example Term Schedule:**
- Term 1: January 8 - April 12
- Term 2: April 22 - August 2
- Term 3: August 19 - December 6

### Active Term

Only ONE term can be active at a time. The active term:
- Receives new Goal Check data
- Appears in dashboard metrics
- Is used for report generation

**Changing Active Term:**
1. Navigate to Academic Terms
2. Find the term you want to activate
3. Click "Set Active"
4. Confirm the change

<Warning>
**Important:** Changing the active term does NOT delete old data. Historical term data remains accessible for reporting.
</Warning>

## Learning Centre Management

### Creating Learning Centres

Learning centres are your classrooms. Most ACE schools have 3-10 centres.

1. Navigate to "Learning Centres"
2. Click "Create Centre"
3. Fill in:
   - **Centre Name:** E.g., "Faith Centre", "Grace Centre", "Hope Centre"
   - **Description:** Optional notes about the centre
   - **Capacity:** Optional maximum student count (e.g., 25)
4. Click "Save"

### Naming Conventions

Many ACE schools use Christian-inspired names:
- Faith, Hope, Love, Grace, Joy, Peace
- Joshua, David, Esther, Ruth, Daniel
- Foundation, Cornerstone, Promise, Covenant

**Tip:** Keep names short and distinct for easy identification in reports.

### Assigning Supervisors

Each learning centre should have at least one supervisor.

1. Open a learning centre detail page
2. Click "Assign Supervisor"
3. Select supervisor(s) from the list
4. Click "Save"

**Notes:**
- Supervisors can be assigned to multiple centres
- Supervisors only see data for their assigned centres
- You can change assignments anytime

### Deactivating Centres

When a centre is no longer in use (e.g., due to enrollment changes):

1. Open the centre detail page
2. Click "Deactivate Centre"
3. Confirm

**What Happens:**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Students not appearing in Goal Check"
**Solution:** Ensure students have PACE assignments. Students need assigned PACEs before goals can be set.

### "Centre report won&apos;t generate"
**Solution:** Check readiness indicator. All students in the centre must be marked before report can generate.

### "Dashboard shows 0 students"
**Solution:** Verify students are active (not deactivated) and assigned to learning centres.

### "Staff can&apos;t see any data"
**Solution:** Check staff member&apos;s assigned centres. Supervisors/monitors only see data for assigned centres.

### "Wrong timezone on reports"
**Solution:** Update school profile timezone. Note: This won&apos;t retroactively fix old data.
